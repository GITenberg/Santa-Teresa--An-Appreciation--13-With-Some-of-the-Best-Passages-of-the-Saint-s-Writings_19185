1</span>APPRECIATION AND INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>With a view to the work of my classes this session, I took old
Abraham Woodhead&rsquo;s two black-letter quartos with me to the 
Engadine last July.&nbsp; And I spent every rainy morning and 
every tired evening of that memorable holiday month in the 
society of Santa Teresa and her excellent old-English 
translator.&nbsp; Till, ever, as I crossed the Morteratch and the
Roseg, and climbed the hills around Maloggia and Pontresina, a 
voice would come after me, saying to me, Why should you not share
all this spiritual profit and intellectual delight with your 
Sabbath evening congregations, and with your young men&rsquo;s 
and young women&rsquo;s classes?&nbsp; Why should you not 
introduce Santa Teresa to her daughters in Edinburgh?&nbsp; For 
her daughters they are, so soon and as long as they live in 
self-knowledge and in self-denial, in humility and in meekness, 
and especially in unceasing prayer for themselves and for 
others.&nbsp; <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>And I am not without some assurance 
that in this present lecture I am both hearing and obeying one of
those same locutions that Teresa heard so frequently, and obeyed 
with such instancy and fidelity and fruitfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Luther was born in 1483, and he nailed his ninety-five theses 
to the door of the University Church of Wittenberg on the 31st 
October 1517.&nbsp; Loyola was born in 1491, and Xavier in 1506, 
and the Society of Jesus was established in 1534.&nbsp; Isabella 
the Catholic was born in 1451, and our own Protestant Elizabeth 
in 1533.&nbsp; The Spanish Inquisition began to sit in 1483, the 
Breviary was finally settled in 1568, and the Armada was 
destroyed in 1588.&nbsp; Columbus was born in 1446, and he set 
out on his great enterprise in 1492.&nbsp; Cervantes was born in 
1547, and the First Part of his immortal work was published in 
1605.&nbsp; And it is to be read in Santa Teresa&rsquo;s Breviary
to this day that Teresa the Sinner was born on the 29th day of 
March 1515, at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; She died 
in 1582, and in 1622 she was publicly canonised at Rome along 
with Loyola and Xavier and two other Spanish saints.</p>
<p>Teresa was greatly blessed in both her <!-- page 3--><a 
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>parents.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;It helped me much that I never saw my father or my mother 
respect anything in any one but goodness.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her father
was a great reader of the best books, and he took great pains 
that his children should form the same happy habit and should 
carefully cultivate the same excellent taste.&nbsp; Her mother, 
while a Christian gentlewoman of the first social standing, did 
not share her husband&rsquo;s love of serious literature.&nbsp; 
She passed far too much of her short lifetime among the romances 
of the day, till her daughter has to confess that she took no 
little harm from the books that did her mother no harm but 
pastime to read.&nbsp; As for other things, her father&rsquo;s 
house was a perfect model of the very best morals and the very 
best manners.&nbsp; Alonso de Cepeda was a well-born and a 
well-bred Spanish gentleman.&nbsp; He came of an ancient and an 
illustrious Castilian stock; and, though not a rich man, his 
household enjoyed all the nobility of breeding and all the 
culture of mind and all the refinement of taste for which Spain 
was so famous in that great age.&nbsp; All her days, and in all 
her ups and downs in life, we continually trace back to 
Teresa&rsquo;s noble birth and noble upbringing no little of her 
supreme stateliness of deportment and serenity of manner <!-- 
page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and
chivalry of character.&nbsp; Teresa was a perfect Spanish lady, 
as well as a mother in Israel, and no one who ever conversed with
her could for a moment fail to observe that the oldest and best 
blood of Spain mantled in her cheek and shone in her eye.&nbsp; A
lion encompassed by crosses was one of the quarters of her 
father&rsquo;s coat of arms.&nbsp; And Teresa took that up and 
added out of it a new glory to all her father&rsquo;s hereditary 
honours.&nbsp; For his daughter was all her days a lioness 
palisaded round with crosses, till by means of them she was 
transformed into a lamb.&nbsp; But, all the time, the lioness was
still lurking there.&nbsp; Teresa&rsquo;s was one of those 
sovereign souls that are born from time to time as if to show us 
what our race was created for at first, and for what it is still 
destined.&nbsp; She was a queen among women.&nbsp; She was in 
intellect the complete equal, and in still better things than 
intellect far the superior, of Isabella and Elizabeth 
themselves.&nbsp; As she says in an outspoken autobiographic 
passage, hers was one of those outstanding and towering souls on 
which a thousand eyes and tongues are continually set without any
one understanding them or comprehending them.&nbsp; Her coming 
greatness of soul is foreseen by some of her biographers in the 
attempt which she <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>made while yet a child to escape away 
into the country of the Moors in search of an early martyrdom, so
that she might see her Saviour all the sooner, and stand in His 
presence all the purer.&nbsp; &lsquo;A woman,&rsquo; says 
Crashaw, &lsquo;for angelical height of speculation: for 
masculine courage of performance, more than a woman; who, while 
yet a child, outran maturity, and durst plot a martyrdom.</p>
<blockquote><p>Scarce had she learnt to lisp the name<br />
Of martyr, yet she thinks it shame<br />
Life should so long sport with that breath,<br />
Which, spent, can buy so brave a death.</p>
<p>Scarce had she blood enough to make<br />
A guilty sword blush for her sake;<br />
Yet has she heart dares hope to prove<br />
How much less strong is death than love.</p>
<p>Be love but there, let poor six years<br />
Be posed with the maturest fears<br />
Man trembles at, we straight shall find<br />
Love knows no nonage, nor the mind.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teresa&rsquo;s mother died just when her daughter was at that 
dangerous age in which a young girl needs a wise mother most; 
&lsquo;the age when virtue should begin to grow,&rsquo; as she 
says herself.&nbsp; Teresa was an extraordinarily handsome and 
attractive young lady, and the knowledge of that, as she tells 
us, made her very vain, and puffed up her heart with foolish 
imaginations.&nbsp; <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>She has a powerful chapter in the 
opening of her Autobiography on dangerous companionships in the 
days of youth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh that all parents would take 
warning by me, and would look carefully into their 
children&rsquo;s early friendships!&rsquo;&nbsp; She suffered 
terribly from bad health all her days, and that severe 
chastisement began to fall on her while she was yet a beautiful 
girl.&nbsp; It was a succession of serious illnesses, taken along
with her father&rsquo;s scrupulous care over her, that brought 
Teresa back to the simple piety of her early childhood, and fixed
her for life in an extraordinary devotion to God, and to all the 
things of God.&nbsp; When such a change of heart and character 
comes to a young woman among ourselves, she usually seeks out 
some career of religion and charity to which she can devote her 
life.&nbsp; She is found labouring among the poor and the sick 
and the children of the poor, or she goes abroad to foreign 
mission work.&nbsp; In Teresa&rsquo;s land and day a Religious 
House was the understood and universal refuge for any young woman
who was in earnest about her duty to God and to her own 
soul.&nbsp; In those Houses such young women secluded themselves 
from all society and gave themselves up to the care of the poor 
and the young.&nbsp; In the more strict and enclosed <!-- page 
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>of those
retreats the inmates never came out of doors at all, but wholly 
sequestered themselves up to a secret life of austerity and 
prayer.&nbsp; This was the ideal life led in those Houses for 
religious women.&nbsp; But Teresa soon found out the tremendous 
mistake she had made in leaving her father&rsquo;s 
family-fireside for a so-called Religious House.&nbsp; No sooner 
had she entered it than she was plunged headlong into those very 
same &lsquo;pestilent amusements,&rsquo; the mere approach of 
which had made her flee to this supposed asylum.&nbsp; Though she
is composing her Autobiography under the sharp eyes of her 
confessors, and while she is writing with a submissiveness and, 
indeed, a servility that is her only weakness, Teresa at the same
time is bold enough and honest enough to tell us her own 
experiences of monastic life in language of startling strength 
and outspokenness.&nbsp; &lsquo;A short-cut to hell.&nbsp; If 
parents would take my advice, they would rather marry their 
daughters to the very poorest of men, or else keep them at home 
under their own eye.&nbsp; If young women will be wicked at home,
their wickedness will not long be hidden at home; but in 
monasteries, such as I speak of, their worst wickedness can be 
completely covered up from every human eye.&nbsp; And all the 
time the poor <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>things are not to blame.&nbsp; They 
only walk in the way that is shown them.&nbsp; Many of them are 
to be much pitied, for they honestly wish to withdraw from the 
world, only to find themselves in ten times worse worlds of 
sensuality and all other devilry.&nbsp; O my God! if I might I 
would fain speak of some of the occasions of sin from which Thou 
didst deliver me, and how I threw myself into them again.&nbsp; 
And of the risks I ran of utterly shipwrecking my character and 
good name and from which Thou didst rescue me.&nbsp; O Lord of my
soul! how shall I be able to magnify Thy grace in those perilous 
years!&nbsp; At the very time that I was offending Thee most, 
Thou didst prepare me by a most profound compunction to taste of 
the sweetness of Thy recoveries and consolations.&nbsp; In truth,
O my King, Thou didst administer to me the most spiritual and 
painful of chastisements: for Thou didst chastise my sins with 
great assurances of Thy love and of Thy great mercy.&nbsp; It 
makes me feel beside myself when I call to mind Thy great grace 
and my great ingratitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This leads us up to the conception and commencement of that 
great work to which Teresa dedicated the whole of her after 
life,&mdash;the reformation and extension of the Religious <!-- 
page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>Houses of Spain.&nbsp; The root-and-branch reformation of
Luther and his German and Swiss colleagues had not laid much hold
on Spain; and the little hold it had laid on her native land had 
never reached to Teresa.&nbsp; Had Luther and Teresa but met: had
Melanchthon and Teresa but met: had the best books of the German 
and Swiss Reformation but come into Teresa&rsquo;s hands: had she
been somewhat less submissive, and somewhat less obedient, and 
somewhat less completely the slave of her ecclesiastical 
superiors; had she but once entered into that intellectual and 
spiritual liberty wherewith Christ makes His people 
free,&mdash;what a lasting blessing Teresa might have been made 
to her native land!&nbsp; But, as it was, Teresa&rsquo;s 
reformation, while it was the salvation of herself and of 
multitudes more who came under it, yet as a monastic experiment 
and a church movement, it ended in the strengthening and the 
perpetuation of that detestable system of intellectual and 
spiritual tyranny which has been the death of Spain from that day
to this.&nbsp; Teresa performed a splendid service inside the 
Church to which she belonged: but that service was wholly 
confined to the Religious Houses that she founded and 
reformed.&nbsp; Teresa&rsquo;s was intended to be a kind of 
counter-reformation <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>to the reformation of Luther and 
Melanchthon and Valdes and Valera.&nbsp; And such was the talent 
and the faith and the energy she brought to bear on the work she 
undertook, that, had it been better directed, it might have been 
blessed to preserve her beloved native land at the head of modern
Christendom.&nbsp; But, while that was not to be, it is the 
immense talent, and the unceasing toil, and the splendid faith 
and self-surrender that Teresa brought to bear on her intramural 
reformation; and, all through that, on the working out of her own
salvation,&mdash;it is all these things that go to make 
Teresa&rsquo;s long life so memorable and so impressive, not only
in her own age and land and church, but wherever greatness of 
mind, and nobleness of heart, and sanctity of life, and 
stateliness of character are heard of and are esteemed.</p>
<p>Teresa&rsquo;s intellect, her sheer power of mind, is enough 
of itself to make her an intensely interesting study to all 
thinking men.&nbsp; No one can open her books without confessing 
the spell of her powerful understanding.&nbsp; Her books, before 
they were books, absolutely captivated and completely converted 
to her unpopular cause many of her most determined enemies.&nbsp;
Again and again and again we find her confessors <!-- page 
11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>and 
her censors admitting that both her spiritual experiences and her
reformation work were utterly distasteful and very stumbling to 
them till they had read her own written account, first of her 
life of prayer and then of her reformation work.&nbsp; One after 
another of such men, and some of them the highest in learning and
rank and godliness, on reading her autobiographic papers, came 
over to be her fearless defenders and fast friends.&nbsp; There 
is nothing more delightful in all her delightful Autobiography, 
and in the fine &lsquo;censures&rsquo; that have been preserved 
concerning it, than to read of the great and learned theologians,
the responsible church leaders, and even the secret inquisitors 
who came under the charm of her character and the spell of her 
pen.&nbsp; &lsquo;She electrifies the will,&rsquo; confessed one 
of the best judges of good writing in her day.&nbsp; And old 
Bishop Palafox&rsquo;s tribute to Teresa is far too beautiful to 
be withheld.&nbsp; &lsquo;What I admire in her is the peace, the 
sweetness, and the consolation with which in her writings she 
draws us toward the best, so that we find ourselves captured 
rather than conquered, imprisoned rather than prisoners.&nbsp; No
one reads the saint&rsquo;s writings who does not presently seek 
God, and no one through her <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>writings 
seeks God who does not remain in love with the saint.&nbsp; I 
have not met with a single spiritual man who does not become a 
passionate admirer of Santa Teresa.&nbsp; But her writings do not
alone impart a rational, interior, and superior love, but a love 
at the same time practical, natural, and sensitive; and my own 
experience proves it to me that there exists no one who loves her
but would, if the saint were still in this world, travel far to 
see and speak with her.&rsquo;&nbsp; I wish much I could add to 
that Peter of Alcantara&rsquo;s marvellous analysis of 
Teresa&rsquo;s experiences and character.&nbsp; Under 
thirty-three heads that great saint sums up Teresa&rsquo;s 
character, and gives us a noble, because all unconscious, 
revelation of his own.&nbsp; And though Teresa has been dead for 
three hundred years, she speaks to this day in that same way: and
that too in quarters in which we would little expect to hear her 
voice.&nbsp; In that intensely interesting novel of modern 
Parisian life, <i>En Route</i>, Teresa takes a chief part in the 
conversion and sanctification of the prodigal son whose return to
his father&rsquo;s house is so powerfully depicted in that 
story.&nbsp; The deeply read and eloquent author of that 
remarkable book gives us some of the best estimates and 
descriptions of Santa Teresa that <!-- page 13--><a 
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>I have 
anywhere met with.&nbsp; &lsquo;That cool-headed business woman .
. . that admirable psychologist and of superhuman lucidity . . . 
that magnificent and over-awing saint . . . she has verified in 
her own case the supernatural experiences of the greatest 
mystics,&mdash;such are her unparalleled experiences in the 
supernatural domain. . . .&nbsp; Teresa goes deeper than any like
writer into the unexplored regions of the soul.&nbsp; She is the 
geographer and hydrographer of the sinful soul.&nbsp; She has 
drawn the map of its poles, marked its latitudes of contemplation
and prayer, and laid out all the interior seas and lands of the 
human heart.&nbsp; Other saints have been among those heights and
depths and deserts before her, but no one has left us so 
methodical and so scientific a survey.&rsquo;&nbsp; Were it for 
nothing else, the chapters on mystical literature in M. 
Huysmans&rsquo; unfinished trilogy would make it a valued 
possession to every student of the soul of man under sin and 
under salvation.&nbsp; I await the completion of his 
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress with great impatience and with great 
expectation.</p>
<p>And then, absolutely possessed as Teresa always is by the most
solemn subjects,&mdash;herself, her sin, her Saviour, her 
original method of prayer and her unshared experiences in 
prayer,&mdash;she showers upon us continually <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>gleams and 
glances of the sunniest merriment, amid all her sighs and 
tears.&nbsp; She roasts in caustic the gross-minded, and the 
self-satisfied, and the self-righteous, as Socrates himself never
roasted them better.&nbsp; Again, like his, her irony and her 
raillery and her satire are sometimes so delicate that it quite 
eludes you for the first two or three readings of the exquisite 
page.&nbsp; And then, when you turn the leaf, she is as 
ostentatiously stupid and ignorant and dependent on your superior
mind as ever Socrates himself was.&nbsp; Till I shrewdly suspect 
that no little of that &lsquo;obedience&rsquo; which so 
intoxicated and fascinated her inquisitors, and which to this day
so exasperates some of her biographers, was largely economical 
and ironical.&nbsp; Her narrow cell is reported to have often 
resounded with peals of laughter to the scandal of some of her 
sisters.&nbsp; In support of all that, I have marked a score of 
Socratic passages in Woodhead, and Dalton, and Lewis, and Father 
Coleridge, and Mrs. Cunninghame Graham.&nbsp; They are very 
delicious passages and very tempting.&nbsp; But were they once 
begun there would be no end to them.&nbsp; You will believe 
Froude, for he is an admitted judge in all matters connected with
the best literature, and he says <!-- page 15--><a 
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>in his 
<i>Quarterly</i> article on Teresa&rsquo;s writings, &lsquo;The 
best satire of Cervantes is not more dainty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The great work to which Teresa gave up her whole life, after 
her full conversion, was the purification of the existing 
monastic system, and the multiplication and extension of 
Religious Houses of the strictest, severest, most secluded, most 
prayerful, and most saintly life.&nbsp; She had been told by 
those she too much trusted, that the Church of Christ was being 
torn in pieces in Germany, and in Switzerland, and in France, and
in England by a great outbreak of heretical error; and, while the
Society of Jesus and the Secret Inquisition were established to 
cope with all such heresy, Teresa set herself to counteract it by
a widespread combination of unceasing penance and intercessory 
prayer.&nbsp; It was a zeal without knowledge; but there can be 
no doubt about the sincerity, the single-mindedness, and the 
strength of the zeal.&nbsp; For forty as hard-working years as 
ever any woman spent in this world, Teresa laboured according to 
her best light to preserve the purity and the unity of the Church
of Christ.&nbsp; And the strength and the sagacity of mind, the 
tact, the business talents, the tenacity of will, the patience, 
the endurance, the perseverance, <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the sleepless
watchfulness, and the abounding prayerfulness that she brought to
bear on the reformation and multiplication of her fortresses of 
defence and attack in that holy war, all taken together, make up 
one of the most remarkable pages in the whole history of the 
Church of Christ.&nbsp; Her difficulties with Rome, with the 
Inquisition, with her more immediate superiors, confessors, and 
censors, and, most of all, with the ignorance, the stupidity, the
laziness, the malice, and the lies of those monks and nuns whose 
reformation she was determined on: her endless journeys: her 
negotiations with church-leaders, landowners, and tradesmen in 
selecting and securing sites, and in erecting new religious 
houses: the adventures, the accidents, the entertainments she met
with: and the fine temper, the good humour, the fascinating 
character, the winning manners she everywhere exhibited; and, 
withal, her incomparable faith in the Living God, and the 
exquisite inwardness, unconquerable assurance, and abounding 
fruitfulness of her own and unshared method and secret of 
prayer,&mdash;had Teresa not lived and died in Spain, and had she
not spent her life and done her work under the Roman obedience, 
her name would have been a household word <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>in 
Scotland.&nbsp; As it is, she is not wholly unknown or 
unloved.&nbsp; And as knowledge extends, and love, and good-will;
and as suspicion, and fear, and retaliation, and party-spirit die
out among us, the truth about Teresa and multitudes more will 
become established on clearer and deeper and broader foundations;
and we shall be able to hail both her and multitudes more like 
her as our brothers and sisters in Christ, whom hitherto we have 
hated and despised because we did not know them, and had been 
poisoned against them.&nbsp; I am a conspicuous case in point 
myself.&nbsp; And when I have been conquered by a little 
desultory reading and by a little effort after love no man need 
despair.&nbsp; And if you will listen to this lecture with a good
and honest heart: with a heart that delights to hear all this 
good report about a fellow-believer: then He who has begun that 
good work in you will perfect it by books and by lectures like 
this, and far better than this, till you are taken absolutely 
captive to that charity which rejoiceth not in iniquity, but 
rejoiceth in the truth: and which beareth all things, believeth 
all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.&nbsp; Follow 
after charity, and begin with Santa Teresa.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Forbid it, mighty Love, let no fond 
hate<br />
Of names or words so far prejudicate;<br />
Souls are not Spaniards too; one friendly flood<br />
Of baptism blends them all into one blood.<br />
What soul soe&rsquo;er in any language can<br />
Speak heaven like hers, is my soul&rsquo;s countryman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the greatest and the best talent that God gives to any man
or woman in this world is the talent of prayer.&nbsp; And the 
best usury that any man or woman brings back to God when He comes
to reckon with them at the end of this world is a life of 
prayer.&nbsp; And those servants best put their Lord&rsquo;s 
money to the exchangers who rise early and sit late, as long as 
they are in this world, ever finding out and ever following after
better and better methods of prayer, and ever forming more 
secret, more steadfast, and more spiritually fruitful habits of 
prayer: till they literally pray without ceasing, and till they 
continually strike out into new enterprises in prayer, and new 
achievements, and new enrichments.&nbsp; It was this that first 
drew me to Teresa.&nbsp; It was her singular originality in 
prayer and her complete captivity to prayer.&nbsp; It was the 
time she spent in prayer, and the refuge, and the peace, and the 
sanctification, and the power for carrying on hard and unrequited
work that she all her life found in prayer.&nbsp; It was her 
fidelity and her <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>utter surrender of herself to this 
first and last of all her religious duties, till it became more a
delight, and, indeed, more an indulgence, than a duty.&nbsp; With
Teresa it was prayer first, and prayer last, and prayer 
always.&nbsp; With Teresa literally all things were sanctified, 
and sweetened, and made fruitful by prayer.&nbsp; In 
Teresa&rsquo;s writings prayer holds much the same place that it 
holds in the best men and women of Holy Scripture.&nbsp; If I 
were to say that about some of the ladies of the Scottish 
Covenant, you would easily believe me.&nbsp; But you must believe
me when I tell you that about a Spanish lady, second to none of 
them in holiness of life, even if her holy life is not all cast 
in our mould.&nbsp; All who have read the autobiographic 
<i>Apologia</i> will remember the fine passage in which its 
author tells us that ever since his conversion there have been 
two, and only two, absolutely self-luminous beings in the whole 
universe of being to him,&mdash;God and his own soul.&nbsp; Now, 
I do not remember that Newman even once speaks about Teresa in 
any of his books, but I always think of him and her together in 
this great respect.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> is to 
them both, and to them both He is a rewarder of them that 
diligently seek Him.&nbsp; And it is just here, at the very 
commencement and centre of divine things, that we all make <!-- 
page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>such shipwreck and come so short.&nbsp; The sense of the
reality of divine and unseen things in Teresa&rsquo;s life of 
prayer is simply miraculous in a woman still living among things 
seen and temporal.&nbsp; Her faith is truly the substance of 
things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.&nbsp; Our 
Lord was as real, as present, as near, as visible, and as affable
to this extraordinary saint as ever He was to Martha, or Mary, or
Mary Magdalene, or the woman of Samaria, or the mother of 
Zebedee&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; She prepared Him where to lay His
head; she sat at His feet and heard His word.&nbsp; She chose the
better part, and He acknowledged to herself and to others that 
she had done so.&nbsp; She washed His feet with her tears, and 
wiped them with the hair of her head.&nbsp; She had been forgiven
much, and she loved much.&nbsp; He said to her, Mary, and she 
answered Him, Rabboni.&nbsp; And He gave her messages to deliver 
to His disciples, who had not waited for Him as she had 
waited.&nbsp; Till she was able to say to them all that she had 
seen the Lord, and that He had spoken such and such things within
her.&nbsp; And hence arises what I may call the quite 
extraordinary purity and spirituality of her life of 
prayer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Defecate&rsquo; is Goodwin&rsquo;s favourite
and constant word for the purest, the most <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>rapt, the 
most adoring, and the most spiritual prayer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have 
known men&rsquo;&mdash;it must have been himself&mdash;&lsquo;who
came to God for nothing else but just to come to Him, they so 
loved Him.&nbsp; They scorned to soil Him and themselves with any
other errand than just purely to be alone with Him in His 
presence.&nbsp; Friendship is best kept up, even among men, by 
frequent visits; and the more free and defecate those frequent 
visits are, and the less occasioned by business, or necessity, or
custom they are, the more friendly and welcome they 
are.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, I have sometimes wondered what took Teresa
so often, and kept her so long, alone with God.&nbsp; Till I 
remembered Goodwin&rsquo;s classical passages about defecated 
prayer, and understood something of what is involved and what is 
to be experienced in pure and immediate communion with God.&nbsp;
And, then, from all that it surely follows, that no one is fit 
for one moment to have an adverse or a hostile mind, or to pass 
an adverse or a hostile judgment, on the divine manifestations 
that came to Teresa in her unparalleled life of prayer; no one 
who is not a man of like prayer himself; no, nor even then.&nbsp;
I know all the explanations that have been put forward for 
Teresa&rsquo;s &lsquo;locutions&rsquo; and revelations; but after
anxiously weighing <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>them all, the simplest explanation is
also the most scientific, as it is the most scriptural.&nbsp; If 
our ascending Lord actually said what He is reported to have said
about the way that He and His Father will always reward all love 
to Him, and the keeping of all His commandments; then, if there 
is anything true about Teresa at all, it is this, that from the 
day of her full conversion she lived with all her might that very
life which has all these transcendent promises spoken and sealed 
to it.&nbsp; By her life of faith and prayer and personal 
holiness, Teresa made herself &lsquo;capable of God,&rsquo; as 
one describes it, and God came to her and filled her with Himself
to her utmost capacity, as He said He would.&nbsp; At the same 
time, much as I trust and honour and love Teresa, and much good 
as she has been made of God to me, she was still, at her best, 
but an imperfectly sanctified woman, and her rewards and 
experiences were correspondingly imperfect.&nbsp; But if a holy 
life before such manifestations were made to her, and a still 
holier life after them&mdash;if that is any test of the truth and
reality of such transcendent and supernatural matters,&mdash;on 
her own humble and adoring testimony, and on the now extorted and
now spontaneous testimony of absolutely all who lived near her, 
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>still more humility, meekness, lowly-mindedness, 
heavenly-mindedness and prayerfulness demonstrably followed those
inward and spiritual revelations to her of her Lord.&nbsp; In 
short and in sure, ye shall know them by their fruits.&nbsp; Do 
men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?&nbsp; On the 
whole, then, I for one am strongly disposed toward Teresa, even 
in the much-inculpated matter of her inward voices and 
visions.&nbsp; The wish may very possibly be father to the 
thought: but my thought leans to Teresa, even in her most 
astounding locutions and revelations; they answer so entirely to 
my reading of our Lord and of His words.&nbsp; I take sides, on 
the whole, with those theologians of her day, who began by 
doubting, but ended by believing in Teresa and by imitating 
her.&nbsp; They were led to rejoice that any contemporary and 
fellow-sinner had attained to such fellowship with God: and I am 
constrained to take sides with them.&nbsp; &lsquo;One day, in 
prayer, the sweetness was so great that I could not but contrast 
it with the place I deserved in hell.&nbsp; The sweetness and the
light and the peace were so great that, compared with it, 
everything in this world is vanity and lies.&nbsp; I was filled 
with a new reverence for God.&nbsp; I saw His majesty and His 
power in a way I cannot <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>describe, and the vision kept me in 
great tenderness and joy and humility.&nbsp; I cannot help making
much of that which led me so near to God.&nbsp; I knew at that 
great moment what it is for a soul to be in the very presence of 
God Himself.&nbsp; What must be the condescension of His majesty 
seeing that in so short a time He left so great an impression and
so great a blessing on my soul!&nbsp; O my Lord, consider who she
is upon whom Thou art bestowing such unheard-of blessings!&nbsp; 
Dost Thou forget that my soul has been an abyss of sin?&nbsp; How
is this, O Lord, how can it be that such great grace has come to 
the lot of one who has so ill deserved such things at Thy 
hands!&rsquo;&nbsp; He who can read that, and a hundred passages 
as good as that, and who shall straightway set himself to sneer 
and scoff and disparage and find fault, he is well on the way to 
the sin against the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; At any rate, I would be if 
I did not revere and love and imitate such a saint of God.&nbsp; 
Given God and His Son and His Holy Spirit: given sin and 
salvation and prayer and a holy life; and, with many drawbacks, 
Teresa&rsquo;s was just the life of self-denial and repentance 
and prayer and communion with God that we should all live.&nbsp; 
It is not Teresa who is to be bemoaned and blamed and called bad 
names.&nbsp; <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>It is we who do all that to her who 
are beside ourselves.&nbsp; It is we who need the beam to be 
taken out of our own eye.&nbsp; Teresa was a mystery and an 
offence; and, again, an encouragement and an example to the 
theologians and the inquisitors of her day just as she still is 
in our day.&nbsp; She was a stumbling-stone, or an ensample, 
according to the temper and disposition and character of her 
contemporaries, and she is the same to-day.</p>
<p>The pressing question with me is not the truth or the 
falsehood, the amount of reality or the amount of imagination in 
Teresa&rsquo;s locutions and visions.&nbsp; The pressing question
with me is this,&mdash;Why it is that I have nothing to show to 
myself at all like them.&nbsp; I think I could die for the truth 
of my Lord&rsquo;s promise that both He and His Father will 
manifest Themselves to those who love Him and keep His words; but
He never manifests Himself, to be called manifestation, to 
me.&nbsp; I am driven in sheer desperation to believe such 
testimonies and attainments as those of Teresa, if only to 
support my failing faith in the words of my Master.&nbsp; I had 
rather believe every syllable of Teresa&rsquo;s so-staggering 
locutions and visions than be left to this, that ever since Paul 
and John went home to heaven our Lord&rsquo;s greatest promises 
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>have been so many idle words.&nbsp; It is open to any 
man to scoff and sneer at Teresa&rsquo;s extraordinary life of 
prayer, and at the manifestations of the Father and the Son that 
were made to her in her life of prayer, and some of her 
biographers and censors among ourselves have made good use of 
their opportunity.&nbsp; But I cannot any longer sit with them in
the seat of the scorner, and I want you all to rise up and leave 
that evil seat also.&nbsp; Lord, how wilt Thou manifest Thyself 
in time to come to me?&nbsp; How shall I attain to that faith and
to that love and to that obedience which shall secure to me the 
long-withheld presence and indwelling of the Father and the 
Son?</p>

<p>Teresa&rsquo;s <i>Autobiography</i>, properly speaking, is not
an autobiography at all, though it ranks with <i>The 
Confessions</i>, and <i>The Commedia</i>, and <i>The Grace 
Abounding</i>, and <i>The Reliquiae</i>, as one of the very best 
of that great kind of book.&nbsp; It is not really Teresa&rsquo;s
<i>Life Written by Herself</i>, though all that stands on its 
title-page.&nbsp; It is only one part of her life: it is only her
life of prayer.&nbsp; The title of the book, she says in one 
place, is not her life at all, but <i>The Mercies of 
God</i>.&nbsp; Many other matters come up incidentally in this 
delightful book, but the whole drift and <!-- page 27--><a 
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the real 
burden of the book is its author&rsquo;s life of prayer.&nbsp; 
Her attainments and her experiences in prayer so baffled and so 
put out all her confessors that, at their wits&rsquo; end, they 
enjoined her to draw out in writing a complete account of a 
secret life, the occasional and partial discovery of which so 
amazed, and perplexed, and condemned them.&nbsp; And thus it is 
that we come to possess this unique and incomparable 
autobiography: this wonderful revelation of Teresa&rsquo;s soul 
in prayer.&nbsp; It is a book in which we see a woman of 
sovereign intellectual ability working out her own salvation in 
circumstances so different from our own that we have the greatest
difficulty in believing that it was really salvation at all she 
was so working out.&nbsp; Till, as we read in humility and in 
love, we learn to separate-off all that is local, and secular, 
and ecclesiastical, and circumstantial, and then we immensely 
enjoy and take lasting profit out of all that which is so truly 
Catholic and so truly spiritual.&nbsp; Teresa was an 
extraordinary woman in every way: and that comes out on every 
page of her Autobiography.&nbsp; So extraordinary that I confess 
there is a great deal that she tells us about herself that I do 
not at all understand.&nbsp; She was Spanish, and we are 
Scottish.&nbsp; She and we are wide as the poles <!-- page 
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>asunder.&nbsp; Her lot was cast of God in the sixteenth 
century, whereas our lot is cast in the nineteenth.&nbsp; She was
a Roman Catholic mystic, and we are Evangelical 
Protestants.&nbsp; But it is one of the great rewards of studying
such a life as Teresa&rsquo;s to be able to change places with 
her so as to understand her and love her.&nbsp; She was, without 
any doubt or contradiction, a great saint of God.&nbsp; And a 
great saint of God is more worthy of our study and admiration and
imitation and love than any other study or admiration or 
imitation or love on the face of the earth.&nbsp; And the further
away such a saint is from us the better she is for our study and 
admiration and imitation and love, if we only have the sense and 
the grace to see it.</p>
<p>Cervantes himself might have written Teresa&rsquo;s <i>Book of
the Foundations</i>.&nbsp; Certainly he never wrote a better 
book.&nbsp; For myself I have read Teresa&rsquo;s 
<i>Foundations</i> twice at any rate for every once I have read 
Cervantes&rsquo; masterpiece.&nbsp; For literature, for humour, 
for wit, for nature, for photographic pictures of the time and 
the people, her <i>Foundations</i> are a masterpiece also: and 
then, Teresa&rsquo;s pictures are pictures of the best people in 
Spain.&nbsp; And there was no finer people in the whole of 
Christendom <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>in that day than the best of the 
Spanish people.&nbsp; God had much people in the Spain of that 
day, and he who is not glad to hear that will never have a place 
among them.&nbsp; The Spain of that century was full of family 
life of the most polished and refined kind.&nbsp; And, with all 
their declensions and corruptions, the Religious Houses of Spain 
enclosed multitudes of the most saintly men and women.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I never read of a hermit,&rsquo; said Dr. Johnson to 
Boswell in St. Andrews, &lsquo;but in imagination I kiss his 
feet: I never read of a monastery, but I could fall on my knees 
and kiss the pavement.&nbsp; I have thought of retiring myself, 
and have talked of it to a friend, but I find my vocation is 
rather in active life.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was such monasteries as 
Teresa founded and ruled and wrote the history of that made such 
a sturdy Protestant as Dr. Johnson was say such a thing as 
that.&nbsp; <i>The Book of the Foundations</i> is Teresa&rsquo;s 
own account, written also under superior orders, of that great 
group of religious houses which she founded and administered for 
so many years.&nbsp; And the literature into which she puts all 
those years is literature of the first water.&nbsp; A thousand 
times I have been reminded of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza as I 
read Teresa&rsquo;s account <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of her 
journeys, and of the people, and of the escapades, and of the 
entertainments she met with.&nbsp; Yes, quite as good as 
Cervantes! yes, quite as good as Goldsmith!&mdash;I have caught 
myself exclaiming as I read and laughed till the tears ran down 
my cheeks.&nbsp; This is literature, this is art without the art,
this is literary finish without the labour: and all laid out to 
the finest of all uses, to tell of the work of God, and of all 
the enterprises, providences, defeats, successes, recompenses, 
connected with it.&nbsp; The <i>Foundations</i> is a Christian 
classic even in Woodhead&rsquo;s and Dalton&rsquo;s and David 
Lewis&rsquo;s English, what must it then be to those to whom 
Teresa&rsquo;s exquisite Spanish is their mother-tongue!</p>
<p>If Vaughan had but read <i>The Foundations</i>, which he is 
honest enough to confess he had only glanced at in a French 
translation, it would surely have done something to make him 
reconsider the indecent and disgraceful attack which he makes on 
Teresa.&nbsp; His chapter on Teresa is a contemptuous and a 
malicious caricature.&nbsp; Vaughan has often been of great 
service to me, but if I had gone by that misleading chapter, I 
would have lost weeks of most intensely interesting and 
spiritually profitable reading.&nbsp; Vaughan&rsquo;s extravagant
misrepresentation <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of Teresa will henceforth make me 
hesitate to receive his other judgments till I have read the 
books myself.&nbsp; I shall not tarry here to controvert 
Vaughan&rsquo;s utterly untruthful chapter on Teresa, I shall 
content myself with setting over against it Crashaw&rsquo;s 
exquisite <i>Hymn</i> and <i>Apology</i>, and especially his 
magnificent <i>Flaming Heart</i>.</p>
<p>Teresa&rsquo;s <i>Way of Perfection</i> is a truly fine book: 
full of freshness, suggestiveness, and power.&nbsp; So much so, 
that I question if William Law&rsquo;s <i>Christian 
Perfection</i> would ever have been written, but that Teresa had 
written on that same subject before him.&nbsp; I do not say that 
Law plagiarised from Teresa, but some of his very best passages 
are plainly inspired by his great predecessor.&nbsp; You will 
thank me for the following eloquent passage from Mrs. Cunninghame
Graham, which so felicitously characterises this great book, and 
that in language such as I could not command.&nbsp; &lsquo;To my 
thinking Teresa is at her best in her <i>Way of Perfection</i> 
with its bursts of impassioned eloquence; its shrewd and caustic 
irony; its acute and penetrating knowledge of human character, 
the same in the convent as in the world; above all in its 
sympathetic and tender instinct for the needs and difficulties of
her <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>daughters.&nbsp; <i>The Perfection</i> represents the 
finished and magnificent fabric of the spiritual life.&nbsp; Her 
words ring with a strange terseness and earnestness as she here 
pens her spiritual testament.&nbsp; She points out the 
mischievous foibles, the little meannesses, the spirit of 
cantankerousness and strife, which long experience of the 
cloister had shown her were the besetting sins of the conventual 
life.&nbsp; She places before them the loftier standard of the 
Cross.&nbsp; Her words, direct and simple, ring out true and 
clear, producing somewhat the solemn effect of a Commination 
Service.&rsquo;&nbsp; Strong as that estimate is, <i>The 
Perfection</i> deserves every word of it and more.</p>
<p>Teresa thought that her <i>Mansions</i> was one of her two 
best books, but she was surely far wrong in that.&nbsp; <i>The 
Mansions</i>, sometimes called <i>The Interior Castle</i>, to me 
at any rate, is a most shapeless, monotonous, and wearisome 
book.&nbsp; Teresa had a splendid imagination, but her 
imagination had not the architectonic and dramatic quality that 
is necessary for carrying out such a conception as that is which 
she has laid in the ground-plan of this book.&nbsp; No one who 
has ever read <i>The Purgatorio</i> or <i>The Holy War</i> could 
have patience with the shapeless and inconsequent 
<i>Mansions</i>.&nbsp; There is nothing that is new <!-- page 
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>in 
the matter of the <i>Mansions</i>; there is nothing that is not 
found in a far better shape in some of her other books; and one 
is continually wearied out by her utter inability to handle the 
imagery which she will not let alone.&nbsp; At the same time, the
persevering reader will come continually on characteristic things
that are never to be forgotten as he climbs with Teresa from 
strength to strength on her way to her Father&rsquo;s House.</p>
<p>To my mind Teresa is at her very best, not in her 
<i>Mansions</i> which she made so much of, but in her 
<i>Letters</i> which she made nothing of.&nbsp; I think I prefer 
her <i>Letters</i> to all her other books.&nbsp; A great service 
was done to this fine field of literature when Teresa&rsquo;s 
letters were collected and published.&nbsp; What 
Augustine&rsquo;s editor has so well said about Augustine&rsquo;s
letters I would borrow and would apply to Teresa&rsquo;s 
letters.&nbsp; All her other works receive fresh light from her 
letters.&nbsp; The subjects of her more elaborate writings are 
all handled in her letters in a far easier, a far more natural, 
and a far more attractive manner.&nbsp; It is in her letters that
we first see the size and the strength and the sweep of her mind,
and discover the deserved deference that is paid to her on all 
hands.&nbsp; Burdened churchmen, inquiring students in <!-- page 
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the 
spiritual life, perplexed confessors, angry and remonstrating 
monks, husbands and wives, matrons and maidens, all find their 
way to Mother Teresa.&nbsp; Great bundles of letters are 
delivered at the door of her cell every day, and she works at her
answers to those letters till a bird begins to flutter in the top
of her head, after which her physician will not suffer her to 
write more than twelve letters at a downsitting.&nbsp; And what 
letters they are, all sealed with the name of <span 
class="smcap">Jesus</span>&mdash;she will seal now with no other 
seal.&nbsp; What letters of a strong and sound mind go out under 
that seal!&nbsp; What a business head!&nbsp; What shrewdness, 
sagacity, insight, frankness, boldness, archness, raillery, 
downright fun!&nbsp; And all as full of splendid sense as an egg 
is full of meat.&nbsp; If Andrew Bonar had only read Spanish, and
had edited Teresa&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i> as he has edited 
Rutherford&rsquo;s, we would have had that treasure in all our 
houses.&nbsp; As it is, Father Coleridge long ago fell on the 
happy idea of compiling a <i>Life of Teresa</i> out of her extant
letters, and he has at last carried out his idea, if not in all 
its original fulness, yet in a very admirable and praiseworthy 
way.&nbsp; But I would like to know how many of the boasted 
literary and religious people of Edinburgh have bought and read 
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>Father Coleridge&rsquo;s delightful book.&nbsp; A 
hundred?&nbsp; Ten?&nbsp; Five?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; Or how 
many have so much as borrowed from the circulating library Mrs. 
Cunninghame Graham&rsquo;s first-rate book?&nbsp; Of 
Teresa&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i>, that greatest living authority on 
Teresa says&mdash;&lsquo;That long series of epistolary 
correspondence, so enchanting in the original.&nbsp; It is in her
letters that Teresa is at her best.&nbsp; They reveal all her 
shrewdness about business and money matters; her talent for 
administration; her intense interest in life, and in all that is 
passing around her.&nbsp; Her letters show Teresa as the 
Castilian gentlewoman who not only treats on terms of perfect 
equality with people of the highest rank in the kingdom, but is 
in the greatest request by them.&nbsp; Her letters, of which 
probably only a tithe remains, show us how marvellously the 
horizon of her life had expanded, and how rapidly her fame had 
grown.&nbsp; Perhaps no more finished specimen of epistolary 
correspondence has ever been penned than those letters, written 
in the press of multifarious occupations, and often late at night
when the rest of the convent was sleeping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her confessor, who commanded Teresa to throw her <i>Commentary
on the Song of Solomon</i> into the fire, was a sensible man and 
a true <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>friend to her reputation, and the nun
who snatched a few leaves out of the fire did Teresa&rsquo;s fame
no service.&nbsp; Judging of the whole by the part preserved to 
us, there must have been many things scattered up and down the 
destroyed book well worthy of her best pen.&nbsp; The 
&lsquo;instance of self-esteem&rsquo; which Teresa so 
delightfully narrates is well worth all the burnt fingers its 
preservation had cost the devoted sister: and up and down the 
charred leaves there are passages on conduct and character, on 
obedience and humility and prayer, that Teresa alone could have 
written.&nbsp; All the same, as a whole, her <i>Commentary on the
Song</i> is better in the fire.</p>
<p>Her <i>Seven Meditations on the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer</i> ran no
danger of the censor&rsquo;s fire.&nbsp; I have had occasion to 
read all the best expositions of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in our 
language, and I am bound to say that for originality and striking
suggestiveness Teresa&rsquo;s <i>Seven Meditations</i> stands 
alone.&nbsp; After I had written that extravagant sentence I went
back and read her little book over again, so sure was I that I 
must have overpraised it, and that I would not be believed in 
what I have said concerning it.&nbsp; But after another reading 
of the <i>Meditations</i> I am emboldened to let the strong 
praise stand <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>in all its original strength.&nbsp; I
have passages marked in abundance to prove to demonstration the 
estimate I have formed of this beautiful book, but I must forego 
myself the pleasure and the pride of quoting them.</p>
<p>Sixteen Augustinian <i>Exclamations after having 
Communicated</i>: sixty-nine <i>Advices to Her Daughters</i>, and
a small collection of love-enflamed <i>Hymns</i>, complete what 
remains to us of Teresa&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<p>Teresa died of hard work and worry and shameful neglect, 
almost to sheer starvation.&nbsp; But she had meat to eat that 
all Anne Bartholomew&rsquo;s remaining mites could not buy for 
her dying mother.&nbsp; And, strong in the strength of that 
spiritual meat, Teresa rose off her deathbed to finish her 
work.&nbsp; She inspected with all her wonted quickness of eye 
and love of order the whole of the House into which she had been 
carried to die.&nbsp; She saw everything put into its proper 
place, and every one answering to their proper order, after which
she attended the divine offices for the day, and then went back 
to her bed and summoned her daughters around her.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
children,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you must pardon me much; you 
must pardon me most of all the bad example I have given 
you.&nbsp; Do not imitate me.&nbsp; Do not live as I have <!-- 
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>lived.&nbsp; I have been the greatest sinner in all the 
world.&nbsp; I have not kept the laws I made for others.&nbsp; I 
beseech you, my daughters, for the love of God, to keep the rules
of your Holy Houses as I have never kept them.&nbsp; O my 
Lord,&rsquo; she then turned to Him and said, &lsquo;the hour I 
have so much longed for has surely come at last.&nbsp; The time 
has surely come that we shall see one another.&nbsp; My Lord and 
Saviour, it is surely time for me to be taken out of this 
banishment and be for ever with Thee.&nbsp; The sacrifices of God
are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou 
wilt not despise.&nbsp; Cast me not away from Thy presence, and 
take not Thy Holy Spirit away from me.&nbsp; Create in me a clean
heart, O God.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A broken and a contrite heart; 
a broken and a contrite heart,&rsquo; was her continual cry till 
she died with these words on her lips, &lsquo;A broken and a 
contrite heart Thou wilt not despise.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, thus, 
with the most penitential of David&rsquo;s penitential Psalms in 
her mouth, and with the holy candle of her Church in her hand, 
Teresa of Jesus went forth from her banishment to meet her 
Bridegroom.</p>
<blockquote><p>O sweet incendiary! shew here thy art<br />
Upon this carcass of a cold hard heart;<br />
<!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>Let all thy scatter&rsquo;d shafts of light that play<br
/>
Among the leaves of thy large books of day,<br />
Combined against this breast at once break in<br />
And take away from me myself and sin;<br />
This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be,<br />
And thy best fortune such fair spoils of me.<br />
O thou undaunted daughter of desires!<br />
By all thy dower of lights and fires;<br />
By all the eagle in thee, all the dove;<br />
By all thy lives and deaths of love;<br />
By thy large draughts of intellectual day;<br />
And all thy thirsts of love more large than they;<br />
By all thy brim-filled bowls of fierce desire;<br />
By thy last morning&rsquo;s draught of liquid fire;<br />
By the full kingdom of that final kiss<br />
That seized thy parting soul, and sealed thee His;<br />
By all the Heavens thou hast in Him,<br />
(Fair sister of the Seraphim!);<br />
By all of Him we have in thee;&mdash;<br />
Leave nothing of myself in me.<br />
Let me so read thy life, that I<br />
Unto all life of mine may die.</p>

<p>I had a father and a mother who both feared God.&nbsp; My 
father had his chief delight in the reading of good books, and he
did his best to give his children the same happy taste.&nbsp; 
This also helped me much, that I never saw my father or my mother
regard anything but goodness.&nbsp; Though possessing very great 
beauty in her youth, my mother was never known to set any store 
by it.&nbsp; Her apparel, even in her early married life, was 
that of a woman no longer young.&nbsp; Her life was a life of 
suffering, her death was most Christian.&nbsp; After my 
mother&rsquo;s removal, I began to think too much about my dress 
and my appearance, and I pursued many such like things that I was
never properly warned against, full of mischief though they were 
both to myself and to others.&nbsp; I too early learned every 
evil from an immoral relative.&nbsp; I was very fond of this 
woman&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; I gossiped and talked with her 
continually.&nbsp; She assisted me to all the amusements I loved;
and, what was worse, she found some very evil amusements for me, 
and in every way communicated to me her own vanities and 
mischiefs.&nbsp; I am amazed to think on the evil that <!-- page 
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>one 
bad companion can do; nor could I have believed it, unless I had 
known it by experience.&nbsp; The company and the conversation of
this one woman so changed me that scarcely any trace was left in 
me of my natural disposition to virtue.&nbsp; I became a perfect 
reflection of her and of another who was as bad as she was.</p>
<p>For my education and protection my father sent me to the 
Augustinian Monastery, in which children like myself were brought
up.&nbsp; There was a good woman in that religious house, and I 
began gradually to love her.&nbsp; How impressively she used to 
speak to me of God!&nbsp; She was a woman of the greatest good 
sense and sanctity.&nbsp; She told me how she first came to 
herself by the mere reading of these words of the Gospel, 
&lsquo;Many are called and few chosen.&rsquo;&nbsp; This good 
companionship began to root out the bad habits I had brought to 
that house with me; but my heart had by that time become so hard 
that I never shed a tear, no, not though I read the whole Passion
through.&nbsp; When at last I entered the Religious House of the 
Incarnation for life, our Lord at once made me understand how He 
helps those who do any violence to themselves in order to serve 
Him.&nbsp; No one observed this violence in me.&nbsp; They saw 
nothing in me but the greatest goodwill.&nbsp; At that sore step 
I was filled with a joy so great that it has never wholly left me
to this day.&nbsp; God converted the dryness of my soul into the 
greatest tenderness, immediately on my taking up that 
cross.&nbsp; Everything in religion was now a real delight to 
me.&nbsp; I had more pleasure now in sweeping the house than I 
had in all the balls and <!-- page 43--><a 
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>dances I had 
forsaken for His sake.&nbsp; Whenever I remember those early 
days, it makes me ready to take up any cross whatsoever.&nbsp; 
For I know now by a long and a various experience that His 
Majesty richly rewards even in this life all the self-denial that
we do for His sake and service.&nbsp; I know this by many 
experiences; and if I were a person who had to advise and guide 
God&rsquo;s people, I would urge them to fear no difficulty 
whatsoever in the path of duty: for our God is omnipotent, and He
is on our side.&nbsp; May He be blessed for ever!&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>O my supreme Good and my true Rest, I know not how to go on 
when I call those happy days to mind, and think of all my evil 
life since then!&nbsp; My tears ought to be tears of blood.&nbsp;
My heart ought to break.&nbsp; But Thou, Lord, hast borne with me
for almost twenty years, till I have had time to improve.&nbsp; 
And all that it might be better known to me who Thou art and what
I am.&nbsp; Woe is me, my Maker!&nbsp; I have no excuse, I have 
only blame.&nbsp; Let Thy mercy, O Lord, rest on me.&nbsp; Other 
women there have been who have done great deeds in Thy service, 
but I am good only to talk: all my goodness ends in so many 
words: that is all my service of Thee, my God.&nbsp; Cost me what
it may, let me not go on coming to Thee with idle words and empty
hands, seeing that the reward of every one will be according to 
his works.&nbsp; Depart not from me, and I can do all 
things.&nbsp; Depart from me, and I shall return to whence I was 
taken, even to hell.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that move me, who am what I am, to write 
all this even under obedience, and to <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>give an 
account of my wretched life, and of the graces the Lord hath 
wrought in me is this,&mdash;and would that I were a person of 
authority, and then people would perhaps believe what I 
say.&nbsp; This then is what I would say and repeat continually 
if any one would hear me.&nbsp; Let no one ever say: If I fall 
into sin, I cannot then pray.&nbsp; In this the devil turned his 
most dreadful batteries against me.&nbsp; He said to me that it 
showed very little shame in me if I could have the face to pray, 
who had just been so wicked.&nbsp; And under that snare of Satan 
I actually as good as gave up all prayer for a year and a 
half.&nbsp; This was nothing else but to throw myself straight 
down into hell.&nbsp; O my God, was there ever such madness as 
mine!&nbsp; Where could I think to find either pardon for the 
past, or power for the time to come, but from Thee?&nbsp; What 
folly to the stumbler to run away from the light!&nbsp; Let all 
those who would give themselves to prayer, and to a holy life, 
look well to this.&nbsp; They should know that when I was 
shunning prayer because I was so bad, my badness became more 
abandoned than ever it had been before.&nbsp; Rely on the waiting
and abounding goodness of God, which is infinitely greater than 
all the evil you can do.&nbsp; When we acknowledge our vileness, 
He remembers it no more.&nbsp; I grew weary of sinning before God
grew weary of forgiving my sin.&nbsp; He is never weary of giving
grace, nor are his compassions to be exhausted.&nbsp; May He be 
blessed for ever, amen: and may all created things praise 
Him!</p>
<p>I have made a vow&mdash;[it is known as &lsquo;the Teresian 
vow,&rsquo; &lsquo;the seraphic vow,&rsquo; &lsquo;the most 
arduous of vows,&rsquo; <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>&lsquo;a vow yet unexampled in the 
Church&rsquo;], a vow never to offend God in the very least 
matter.&nbsp; I have vowed that I would rather die a thousand 
deaths than do anything of that kind, knowing I was doing 
it.&nbsp; I am resolved also, never to leave anything whatsoever 
undone that I consider to be still more perfect, and more for the
honour of our Lord.&nbsp; Cost me what pain it may, I would not 
leave such an act undone for all the treasures of the 
world.&nbsp; If I were to do so, I do not think I could have the 
face to ask anything of God in prayer: and yet, for all that, I 
have many faults and imperfections remaining in me to this 
day.</p>
<h3>ON THE GODHEAD</h3>
<p>On one occasion when I was in prayer I had a vision in which I
saw how all things are seen in God.&nbsp; I cannot explain what I
saw, but what I saw remains to this day deeply imprinted on my 
soul.&nbsp; It was a great act of grace in God to give me that 
vision.&nbsp; It puts me to unspeakable confusion, shame, and 
horror whenever I recall that magnificent sight, and then think 
of my sin.&nbsp; I believe that had the Lord been pleased to send
me that great revelation of Himself earlier in my life, it would 
have kept me back from much sin.&nbsp; The vision was so 
delicate, so subtle, and so spiritual, that my hard understanding
cannot, at this distance of time, close with it; but, to make use
of an illustration, it was something like this.&nbsp; Suppose the
Godhead to be a vast globe of light, a globe larger than the <!--
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>whole world, and that all our actions are seen in that 
all-embracing globe.&nbsp; It was something like that I 
saw.&nbsp; For I saw all my most filthy actions gathered up and 
reflected back upon me from that World of light.&nbsp; I tell you
it was a piteous and a dreadful thing to see.&nbsp; I knew not 
where to hide myself, for that shining light, in which was no 
darkness at all, held the whole world within it, and all 
worlds.&nbsp; You will see that I could not flee from its 
presence.&nbsp; Oh that they could be made to see this who commit
deeds of darkness!&nbsp; Oh that they but saw that there is no 
place secret from God: but that all they do is done before Him, 
and in Him!&nbsp; Oh the madness of committing sin in the 
immediate presence of a Majesty so great, and to whose holiness 
all our sin is so hateful.&nbsp; In this also I saw His great 
mercifulness in that He suffers such a sinner as I am still to 
live.</p>
<h3>ON THE SOUL</h3>
<p>O my God, what unspeakable sufferings our souls have to endure
because they have lost their liberty, and are not their own 
masters!&nbsp; What tortures come on them through that!&nbsp; I 
sometimes wonder how I can live through such agony of soul as I 
myself suffer.&nbsp; God be praised who gives me His own life in 
my soul, so that I may escape from so deadly a death!&nbsp; My 
soul has indeed received great strength from His Divine 
Majesty.&nbsp; He has had compassion on my great misery, and has 
helped me.&nbsp; Oh, what a distress it is for my soul to have to
return <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to hold commerce with this world 
after having had its conversation in heaven!&nbsp; To have to 
play a part in the sad farce of this earthly life!&nbsp; And yet 
I am in a strait betwixt two.&nbsp; I cannot run away from this 
world.&nbsp; I must remain in it till my discharge comes.&nbsp; 
But, meantime, how keen is my captivity; how wretched in my own 
soul am I.&nbsp; And one of my worst distresses is this, that I 
am alone in my exile.&nbsp; All around me people seem to have 
found their aim and end in life in this horrible prison-house, 
and to have said, Soul, take thine ease.&nbsp; But the life of my
soul is a life of incessant trouble.&nbsp; The cross is always on
my shoulder; at the same time I surely make some progress.&nbsp; 
God is the Soul of my soul.&nbsp; He engulfs into Himself my 
soul.&nbsp; He enlightens and strengthens my soul.&nbsp; He 
attends to my soul night and day.&nbsp; He gives my soul more and
more grace.&nbsp; This has not come about of myself.&nbsp; No 
effort of mine brought this about.&nbsp; His Majesty does it 
all.&nbsp; And He has held me by the hand, that I might not go 
back.&nbsp; For this reason, it seems to me, the soul in which 
God works His grace, if it walks in humility and in fear, it may 
be led into whatsoever temptation, and thrown into whatsoever 
company, and it will only gain new strength there, and win new 
victories and spoils there.&nbsp; Those are strong souls which 
are chosen of the Lord to work for the souls of others.&nbsp; At 
the same time, their best strength is not their own.&nbsp; All 
that such souls ever attain to and perform, all these things only
make them more humble, and therefore more strong; more able to 
despise the things of this world, and to lay up their <!-- page 
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>treasure in those things which God hath prepared for 
them that love Him.&nbsp; May it please His Majesty that the 
great munificence with which He has dealt with my soul, miserable
sinner that I am, may have some weight with some of those who 
read this, so that they may be strong and courageous to give up 
everything at once and most willingly for such a God!</p>
<h3>ON GOD IN THE SOUL</h3>
<p>This has done me a great deal of good, and it has affected me 
much and opened my eyes in many ways.&nbsp; It is an ennobling 
thing to think that God is more in the soul of man than He is in 
aught else outside of Himself.&nbsp; They are happy people who 
have once got a hold of this glorious truth.&nbsp; In particular,
the Blessed Augustine testifies that neither in the house, nor in
the church, nor anywhere else, did he find God, till once he had 
found Him in himself.&nbsp; Nor had he need to go up to heaven, 
but only down into himself to find God.&nbsp; Nay, he took God to
heaven with him when at last he went there.</p>
<p>Now consider what our Master teaches us to say: &lsquo;Our 
Father which art in heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Think you it concerns 
you little to know where and what that heaven is, and where your 
Heavenly Father is to be sought and found?&nbsp; I tell you that 
for vagrant minds it matters much not only to believe aright 
about heaven, but to procure to understand this matter by 
experience.&nbsp; It is one of those things that strongly bind 
the understanding and recollect the soul.&nbsp; You already <!-- 
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>know that God is in all places: in fine, that where God 
is there heaven is, and where His Majesty most reveals Himself 
there glory is.&nbsp; Consider again what Saint Augustine said, 
that he sought God in many places, till at last he came to find 
Him within himself.&nbsp; You need not go to heaven to see God, 
or to regale yourself with God.&nbsp; Nor need you speak loud as 
if He were far away.&nbsp; Nor need you cry for wings like a dove
so as to fly to Him.&nbsp; Settle yourself in solitude, and you 
will come upon God in yourself.&nbsp; And then entreat Him as 
your Father, and relate to Him your troubles.&nbsp; Those who can
in this manner shut themselves up in the little heaven of their 
own hearts, where He dwells who made heaven and earth, let them 
be sure that they walk in the most excellent way: they lay their 
pipe right up to the fountain.&nbsp; To keep the eyes shut is an 
excellent practice in prayer, because it is a summons and an 
assistance to turn the eyes of the soul within, where God dwells 
and waits in Christ to be gracious.&nbsp; Account thus, that 
there is a great and beautiful palace in your soul; that its 
structure is all of gold and precious stones; that your gifts and
graces are those shining stones, and that the greater your 
virtues are the more those precious stones sparkle.&nbsp; And, 
also, that in this palace the Great King is your guest.&nbsp; He 
sits on the innermost seat of your heart, and holds it to be His 
best and bravest throne.&nbsp; This will seem to some a silly 
fiction.&nbsp; And yet, if you will believe it, fiction as it is,
it will help you much; you especially who are women.&nbsp; For we
women sorely want such assistance to our <!-- page 50--><a 
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>thoughts.&nbsp; And, God grant that it be only women who
need such assistance to show them how base is the use they make 
of themselves.&nbsp; There should be some difference between us, 
both men and women, and the brute beasts.&nbsp; The brute beasts 
are nowhere said to be temples of God, and they are nowhere 
called to account because their god is their belly.&nbsp; O great
God, I tremble to see that I have written such a page as the 
above, being such a wretch as I am.&nbsp; My daughters, in their 
own goodness, will be tempted to think that all this is true of 
myself, and that is a terrible thought to me.&nbsp; On the other 
hand, it is true of God and their own souls.&nbsp; Now let men 
pass a thousand censures on me, and on my way of teaching the 
truth.&nbsp; What of that, if only God and His ways be a little 
better known and loved!&nbsp; My sisters, the King is in His 
palace all this time.&nbsp; There are hostile invasions of His 
borders, and inroads made into His territories, but He abides all
the time on His throne.&nbsp; I smile at the weakness and 
unworthiness of all those comparisons of palaces, and thrones, 
and shining stones, and enemies on the border.&nbsp; They in no 
way satisfy me.&nbsp; But I am a woman, and I can find out no 
better words for you women.&nbsp; Think and say of my words what 
you please.&nbsp; The thing that I have spoken to you is the 
truth.</p>
<h3>ON THE LOVE OF GOD</h3>
<p>The true proficiency of the soul consists not so much in deep 
thinking or eloquent speaking or beautiful writing as in much and
warm loving.&nbsp; <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Now if you ask me in what way this 
much and warm love may be acquired, I answer,&mdash;By resolving 
to do the will of God, and by watching to do His will as often as
occasion offers.&nbsp; Those who truly love God love all good 
wherever they find it.&nbsp; They seek all good to all men.&nbsp;
They encourage all good in all men.&nbsp; They commend all good, 
they always unite themselves with all good, they always 
acknowledge and defend all good.&nbsp; They have no 
quarrels.&nbsp; They bear no envy.&nbsp; O Lord, give me more and
more of this blessed love.&nbsp; Grant me grace not to quit this 
underworld life till I no longer desire anything, nor am capable 
of loving anything, save Thee alone.&nbsp; Grant that I may use 
this word &lsquo;love&rsquo; with regard to Thee alone, since 
there is no solidity for my love to rest on save in Thee.&nbsp; 
The soul has her own ways of understanding, and of finding in 
herself, by certain signs and great conjectures, whether she 
really loves His Divine Majesty or no.&nbsp; Her love is full of 
high impulses, and longings to see and to be with and to be like 
God.&nbsp; All else tires and wearies out the soul.&nbsp; The 
best of created things disappoint and torment the soul.&nbsp; God
alone satisfies the soul, till it is impossible to dissemble or 
mistake such a love.&nbsp; When once I came to see the great 
beauty of our Lord, it turned all other comeliness to corruption 
to me.&nbsp; My heart could rest on nothing and on no one but 
Himself.&nbsp; When anything else would enter my heart I had only
to turn my eyes for a moment in upon that Supreme Beauty that was
engraven within me.&nbsp; So that <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>it is now 
impossible that any created thing can so possess my soul as not 
to be instantly expelled, and my mind and heart set free by a 
little effort to recover the remembrance of the goodness and the 
beauty of our Lord.&nbsp; Good God!&nbsp; What a difference there
is between the love of the Creator and the love of the 
creature!&nbsp; May His Divine Majesty vouchsafe to let us see 
and taste and understand something of this before He takes us out
of this prison-house life, for it will be a magnificent comfort 
in the hour of death to know that we are on our way to be judged 
by Him whom we have loved above all things.&nbsp; We are not 
going to a strange country, since it is His country whom we love 
and who loves us.&nbsp; These things being so, I have this very 
day solaced my soul with our Lord, and have made my moan to Him 
in this manner.&nbsp; O my Lord, why keepest Thou Thy servant in 
this miserable life so long, where all is such vexation, and 
disappointment, and manifold trouble?&nbsp; And not only keepest 
me so long in this banishment, but so hidest Thyself from 
me.&nbsp; Is this worthy of Thee and of Thy great goodness?&nbsp;
Were I what Thou art, and wert Thou what I am, Thou wouldest not 
have to endure it at my hands.&nbsp; I beseech Thee, O my Lord, 
to consider that this is a kind of injury and wrong to proceed 
after this manner with one who loves Thee so much.&nbsp; This and
the like have come into my heart to say: though my bed in hell 
better becomes me than so to speak to my Lord.&nbsp; At the same 
time, the love I bear my Lord sometimes so consumes me that I am 
beside myself, till I scarce know what I <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>say or do; 
and then I find myself making such unbecoming complaints that I 
am amazed our Lord endures them at my hands.&nbsp; Eternal praise
to so good a Lord!</p>
<h3>ON THE LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR</h3>
<p>There are only two duties that our Lord requires of 
us,&mdash;the love of God, and the love of our neighbour.&nbsp; 
And, in my opinion, the surest sign for discovering our love to 
God is our love to our neighbour.&nbsp; And be assured that the 
further you advance in the love of your neighbour, the further 
you are advancing in the love of God likewise.&nbsp; But, oh me, 
how many worms lie gnawing at the roots of our love to our 
neighbour!&nbsp; Self-love, self-esteem, fault-finding, envy, 
anger, impatience, scorn.&nbsp; I assure you I write this with 
great grief, seeing myself to be so miserable a sinner against 
all my neighbours.&nbsp; Our Lord, my sisters, expects 
works.&nbsp; Therefore when you see any one sick, compassionate 
her as if she were yourself.&nbsp; Pity her.&nbsp; Fast that she 
may eat.&nbsp; Wake that she may sleep.&nbsp; Again, when you 
hear any one commended and praised, rejoice in it as much as if 
you were commended and praised yourself.&nbsp; Which, indeed, 
should be easy, because where humility truly is, praise is a 
torment.&nbsp; Cover also your sister&rsquo;s defects as you 
would have your own defects and faults covered and not 
exposed.&nbsp; As often as occasion offers, lift off your 
neighbour&rsquo;s burden.&nbsp; Take it off her heart and on upon
yourself.&nbsp; Satan <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>himself would not be Satan any longer
if he could once love his neighbour as himself.</p>
<p>Endeavour, my daughters, all you can, to be affable to 
all.&nbsp; Demean yourselves so that all who have to do with you 
may love your conversation, so as to desire after your way of 
life.&nbsp; Let no one be affrighted or turned away from the life
of virtue and religion by your gloom and morosity.&nbsp; This 
concerns religious women very much.&nbsp; The more holy they are,
the more affable and sociable should they study to be.&nbsp; 
Never hold aloof from others because their conversation is not 
altogether to your taste.&nbsp; Love them, and they will love 
you, and then they will converse with you, and will become like 
you, and better than you.&nbsp; Let not your soul coop itself up 
in a corner.&nbsp; For, instead of attaining to greater sanctity 
in a proud, and disdainful, and impatient seclusion, the devil 
will keep you company there, and will do your sequestered soul 
much mischief.&nbsp; Bury evil affections in good works.&nbsp; 
Wherefore be accessible and affable to all, and all in 
love.&nbsp; Love is an endless enchantment, and spell, and 
fascination.</p>
<h3>ON OUR SINFULNESS</h3>
<p>This is a very fit place for thinking on our wounds, and 
bruises, and putrifying sores: the blindness of our minds, the 
depravity and the bondage of our wills, the forgetfulness of our 
memories, the slipperiness of our tongues, the levity and 
frivolity of our hearts, with all their extravagances, 
presumptions, neglects.&nbsp; In fine, let there be no spiritual 
wound within us, <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>great or small, old or new, which we 
do not daily discover and lay open to our Sovereign Physician, 
beseeching of Him a remedy.&nbsp; This day it is very proper to 
call to mind the five fountains of our Lord&rsquo;s wounds, which
are still open, and will remain open till the last day for the 
cure of all the sores of our souls.&nbsp; And since out of His 
wounds we receive our spiritual health, let us mollify our wounds
with the ointment of mortification and humility and meekness: in 
all things always employing ourselves for the benefit of our 
neighbour.&nbsp; Since, though we cannot have our Lord visibly 
and in presence beside us, we have our neighbour, who for the 
ends of love and loving service is as good as our Lord 
Himself.</p>
<h3>ON THE WORLD</h3>
<p>I saw that rich and great as she was, she was still a woman, 
and as much liable to all manner of passion and all womanly 
weakness as I was myself.&nbsp; I saw as I lived in her house 
that rank is of little worth, and the higher it is, the greater 
the trouble and the anxiety it brings with it.&nbsp; Great people
must be careful of their dignity.&nbsp; It will not suffer them 
to live at ease.&nbsp; They must eat at fixed hours and by rule, 
for everything must be according to their state, and not 
according to their constitutions.&nbsp; And they have frequently 
to take food more fitted for their state than for their 
liking.&nbsp; So it was that I came to hate the wish to be a 
great lady.&nbsp; God deliver me from this artificial and evil 
life!&nbsp; Then, as to servants, though this lady has very good 
servants, how slight <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>is the trust she is able to put in 
them.&nbsp; One must not be conversed with more than the rest, 
otherwise he is envied and hated of all the rest.&nbsp; This of 
itself is a slavery; and it is another of the lies of the world 
to call such people masters and mistresses, who, in reality, are 
nothing but slaves in a thousand ways.&nbsp; I really see nothing
good in the world and its ways but this, that it will not 
tolerate the smallest fault in those who are not its own.&nbsp; 
For by detracting, and fault-finding, and evil-reporting on the 
good, the world greatly helps to perfect them.&nbsp; He who will 
not die to the world shall die by it.&nbsp; O wretched 
world!&nbsp; Bless God, my daughters, that He has chosen and 
enabled you to turn your backs for ever on a thing so base.&nbsp;
The world is to be known by this also, that it esteems a man not 
by what he is, but by what he possesses: by what is in his purse:
and, that failing, the honour and esteem of the world instantly 
fail also.&nbsp; O our Lord; Supreme Power, Supreme Goodness, 
Supreme Truth; Thy perfections are without beginning and without 
end.&nbsp; They are infinite and incomprehensible.&nbsp; They are
a bottomless ocean of beauty.&nbsp; O my God, that I had the 
eloquence of an angel&rsquo;s speech to set forth Thy goodness 
and Thy truth, and to win all men over to Thee!</p>
<h3>ON EVIL-SPEAKING</h3>
<p>After my vow of perfection I spake not ill of any creature, 
how little soever it might be.&nbsp; I scrupulously avoided all 
approaches to detraction.&nbsp; I had this rule ever present with
me, that I was not <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>to wish, nor assent to, nor say such 
things of any person whatsoever, that I would not have them say 
of me.&nbsp; And as time went on, I succeeded in persuading those
who were about me to adopt the same habit, till it came to be 
understood that where I was absent persons were safe.&nbsp; So 
they were also with all those whom I so instructed.&nbsp; Still, 
for all that, I have a sufficiently strict account to give to God
for the bad example I am to all about me in some other 
respects.&nbsp; May it please His Majesty to forgive me, for I 
have been the cause of much evil.&nbsp; For one thing, the devil 
sometimes fills me with such a harsh and cruel temper: such a 
spirit of anger and hostility at some people, that I could eat 
them up and annihilate them.&nbsp; At the same time, concerning 
things said of myself in detraction, and they are many, and are 
very prejudicial to me, I find myself much improved.&nbsp; These 
things make little impression upon me.&nbsp; I am under them as a
deaf man that hears not, and as a man in whose mouth there is no 
retaliation.&nbsp; Nay, I almost always see that my greatest 
detractors have only too good reason for what they say.&nbsp; In 
this way my soul actually gains peace and strength under 
detraction, till it becomes a great favour done me, and a great 
advantage.&nbsp; Upon betaking myself to prayer, I find in my 
heart neither repugnance at my detractors nor enmity.&nbsp; For, 
although, when I first hear the detraction, it causes me a little
disconcert, yet not any long-lasting disquiet or 
alteration.&nbsp; Nay, sometimes when I see people take pity on 
me because of my detractors, I laugh at them, so little do all my
detractors now hurt me.</p>
<h3><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
58</span>ON SELF-EXCUSING</h3>
<p>That which I am now to persuade you to, namely, the not 
excusing of yourselves, causes a great confusion in me.&nbsp; For
it is a very perfect quality and of great merit; and I ought far 
better to practise what I tell you concerning this excellent 
virtue.&nbsp; I confess myself to be but little improved in this 
noble duty.&nbsp; For it is a mark of the deepest and truest 
humility to see ourselves condemned without cause, and to be 
silent under it.&nbsp; It is a very noble imitation of our 
Lord.&nbsp; Were I truly humble, I would desire disesteem, even 
though having in the matter in hand given no real offence.&nbsp; 
Here no bodily strength is needed, my daughters, nor any 
one&rsquo;s assistance, but God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; How well is this 
written, and how ill is it practised by the writer!&nbsp; Indeed,
I never could make trial of this grace in any matter of 
consequence, because I never heard of any one speaking ill of me,
but I immediately saw how far short he came of the full 
truth.&nbsp; For, if he was wrong or exaggerated in his 
particulars, I had offended God much more in other matters that 
my detractor knew nothing about.&nbsp; And, methought, God 
favoured me much in not proclaiming my secret sins to all 
men.&nbsp; And, thus, I am very glad that my detractor should 
ever report a trifling lie about me, rather than the terrible 
truth.</p>
<p>O my Lord, when I remember in how many ways Thou didst suffer 
detraction and misrepresentation, who in no way deserved it, I 
know not where my senses are when I am in such a haste to defend 
and <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>excuse myself.&nbsp; Is it possible that I should desire
any one to speak any good of me, or to think it, when so many ill
things were thought and spoken of Thee!&nbsp; What is this, O 
Lord; what do we imagine to get by pleasing worms, or being 
praised by them?&nbsp; What about being blamed by all men, if 
only we stand at last blameless before Thee!</p>
<h3>ON PRAISE, PRECEDENCY, AND POINTS OF HONOUR</h3>
<p>Observe carefully the stirrings of your heart in matters of 
superiority.&nbsp; Pray to be delivered from such thoughts as 
these: I am older.&nbsp; I deserve better.&nbsp; I have laboured 
more.&nbsp; I have more talent.&nbsp; Such thoughts are the 
plague and poison of the heart.&nbsp; Believe me, if there remain
in you any allowed hankerings after the praises of men, though 
you may have spent many years in prayer, or rather in idle forms 
of prayer, you have made no progress, and never will, till your 
heart is crucified to the approval and the praise of men.&nbsp; 
If you feel in yourself any point of honour, any pride, any 
desire of eminence or pre-eminence, you must free yourself from 
that abominable bondage, and for that chain there is no hammer 
and file like humility and prayer.&nbsp; Among the rest of my 
great imperfections this was one.&nbsp; I had very little 
knowledge of my Breviary, or of that which was to be sung in the 
choir, and all the while I saw that some other novices could 
instruct me.&nbsp; But I was too proud to ask any 
questions.&nbsp; I was afraid that my great ignorance should be 
discovered.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards a good example was set <!-- 
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>before me, and then, when God had once opened my eyes to
my sinful pride, I was content to ask information and the help 
even of little children.&nbsp; And yet,&mdash;and this surprised 
me, I lost no credit or honour thereby.&nbsp; Nay, it seemed to 
me that my Lord after that gave me better skill and a better 
memory.&nbsp; I could sing but very ill, and I was troubled at 
this, not because I failed in my worship of God, but because so 
many heard me, and thus I was disturbed on the mere point of 
honour and praise.&nbsp; I told them that I could not do what 
others did, and what was expected of me.&nbsp; At first I had 
some difficulty in this, but it soon became both natural and 
pleasant to me to tell the truth.&nbsp; By these 
nothings,&mdash;and they are really nothings, and I am 
sufficiently nothing when such things could put me to so much 
pain,&mdash;and by little and little His Divine Majesty 
vouchsafed to supply me with strength.&nbsp; I was never good at 
the choir, but I tried to do my part for it in folding up the 
mantles of the singers; and, methought, in that I was serving the
angels of God who so well praised Him.&nbsp; I did that also by 
stealth, such was my pride, and my pride was hurt when they 
discovered what I did.&nbsp; O my Lord, who that ever reads this 
can fail to despise and abhor me?&nbsp; I beseech Thy Divine 
Majesty that I may soon be able to leave all such vanities as the
praise and blame of men, and seek Thy praise only!&nbsp; And then
add this, which is worth knowing.&nbsp; The devil will not dare 
to tempt one to pride or precedency who is truly humble because, 
being very crafty, he fears defeat.&nbsp; If you are truly 
humble, you will only grow <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>in that grace
by every temptation to pride or praise.&nbsp; For, immediately on
the temptation, you will reflect on your whole past life and 
present character, and on the stupendous humility of Jesus 
Christ.&nbsp; And by these considerations your tempted soul will 
come off so victorious, that the enemy will think twice before he
comes back, for fear of a broken head.</p>
<h3>ON HUMILITY</h3>
<p>Keep yourselves, my daughters, from that false humility which 
the devil suggests concerning the greatness of your sins.&nbsp; 
For hereby he is wont to disquiet our souls after sundry sorts, 
and to draw us off Holy Communion, and also from prayer.&nbsp; It
is sometimes a great and a true humility to esteem ourselves as 
bad as may be, but at other times it is a false and a spurious 
humility.&nbsp; I know it, for I have experienced it.&nbsp; True 
humility, however great, does not disquiet nor disorder the 
soul.&nbsp; It comes with great peace, and great serenity, and 
great delight.&nbsp; Though we should see our utter wickedness, 
and how truly we deserve to be in hell, and think that both God 
and man must despise and abhor us; yet, if this be a true 
humility, it comes with a certain sweetness and satisfaction 
attending it.&nbsp; This humility does not stifle nor crush the 
soul.&nbsp; It rather dilates the soul, and disposes the soul for
the better service of God.&nbsp; While that other sorrow troubles
all, and confounds all, and destroys all.&nbsp; It is the 
devil&rsquo;s humility when he gets us to distrust God.&nbsp; 
When you find yourselves thus, lay aside all thinking on <!-- 
page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>your own misery, and meditate on the infinite mercy of 
God, and on the inexhaustible merit and grace of Jesus 
Christ.</p>
<p>I was once considering what the reason was why our Lord loved 
humility in us so much, when I suddenly remembered that He is 
essentially the Supreme Truth, and that humility is just our 
walking in the truth.&nbsp; For it is a very great truth that we 
have no good in us, but only misery and nothingness, and he who 
does not understand this walks in lies: but he who understands 
this the best is the most pleasing to the Supreme Truth.&nbsp; 
May God grant us this favour, sisters, never to be without the 
humbling knowledge of ourselves.</p>
<p>O Sovereign Virtues!&nbsp; O Ladies of all the 
creatures!&nbsp; O Empresses of the whole world!&nbsp; Whoever 
hath you may go forth and fight boldly with all hell at 
once.&nbsp; Let your soldiers not fear, for victory is already 
theirs.&nbsp; They only fear to displease God.&nbsp; They 
constantly beseech Him to maintain all the virtues in them.&nbsp;
It is true these virtues have this property, to hide themselves 
from him who possesses them, so that he never sees them in 
himself, nor thinks that he can ever possess a single one of 
them.&nbsp; Other men see all the virtues in him, but he so 
values them that he still pursues them, and seeks them as 
something never to be attained by such as he is.&nbsp; And 
Humility is one of them, and is Queen and Empress and Sovereign 
over them all.&nbsp; In fine, one act of true humility in the 
sight of God is of more worth than all the knowledge, sacred and 
profane, in the whole world.</p>
<h3><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>ON SORROW FOR SIN</h3>
<p>It is indeed a very great misery to live on in this evil world
where our enemies are ever at our gate, and where we can neither 
eat nor sleep in peace, but are compelled to have our armour on 
night and day.&nbsp; There is no rest here, nor happiness, nor 
will be till we are with the Everlastingly Blessed.&nbsp; As I 
write I am seized with terror, lest I should never escape this 
sinful life.&nbsp; Pray for me, my daughters, that Christ may 
ever live in me: for, otherwise, what security can there be for 
such as I am, who have been so wicked.&nbsp; You may sometimes 
have thought, my daughters, that those to whom the Lord 
particularly communicates Himself, will be henceforth secure of 
enjoying Him for ever, and that they will have no need to fear or
bewail their former sins.&nbsp; But this is a great 
mistake.&nbsp; Sorrow for sin increases in proportion as more and
more grace is received from God.&nbsp; And I, for my part, 
believe, that this bitter sorrow will never leave us till we come
where neither sin nor anything else will ever disquiet us.&nbsp; 
True, both past sin, and present sinfulness, affect us more at 
one time than at another; and, likewise, in a different 
manner.&nbsp; I know one who often wishes for death, that she may
be freed from the torment of her sinful heart.&nbsp; No 
one&rsquo;s sins can equal hers, because there can be no one who 
has obtained such favours of her God.&nbsp; Her fear is not so 
much of hell, as that she should so grieve God&rsquo;s Holy 
Spirit, that He will be wearied out, and will forsake her, and 
leave her in her sins.&nbsp; This fear and pain is <!-- page 
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>not 
at all eased by believing that her past sins have all been 
forgiven and forgotten of God.&nbsp; Nay, her fear and pain but 
increase by seeing such mercy extended toward a woman who 
deserves nothing but hell.</p>
<h3>ON LEARNING AND INTELLECT</h3>
<p>I always had a great respect and affection for intellectual 
and learned men.&nbsp; It is my experience that all who intend to
be true Christians will do well to treat with men of mind and 
books about their souls.&nbsp; The more learning our preachers 
and pastors have the better.&nbsp; For if they have not much 
experience themselves, yet they know the Scriptures and the 
recorded experiences of the saints better than we do.&nbsp; The 
devil is exceedingly afraid of learning, especially where it is 
accompanied with humility and virtue.&nbsp; For my own part, I 
bless God continually, and we women, and all such as are not 
ourselves intellectual or learned, are always to give God 
infinite thanks that there are some men in the world who take 
such great pains to attain to that knowledge which we need but do
not possess.&nbsp; And it delights me to see men taking the 
immense trouble they do take to bring me so much profit, and that
without any trouble to me.&nbsp; I have only to sit still and 
hear them.&nbsp; I have only to come and ask them a 
question.&nbsp; Let us pray for our teachers, for what would we 
do without them.&nbsp; I beseech the Lord to bless our teachers, 
that they may be more and more a blessing to us.</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
65</span>When I spoke of humility, it must not be understood as 
if I spoke against aspiring after the highest things that mind 
and heart and life can attain to.&nbsp; For though I have no 
ability for the wisdom and the knowledge of God myself, and am so
miserable that God did me a great favour in teaching me the very 
lowliest truths: yet, in my judgment, learning and knowledge are 
very great possessions, and a great assistance in the life of 
prayer, if only they are always accompanied with humility.&nbsp; 
I have of late seen some very learned men become in addition very
spiritual and prayerful men.&nbsp; And that makes me pray that 
all our men of mind and learning may soon become spiritual men 
and men of much prayer.</p>
<p>Let no one be admitted into this House unless she is a woman 
of a sound understanding.&nbsp; For if she is without mind she 
will neither know herself, nor understand her teachers.&nbsp; For
the most part they that are defective in mind ever think that 
they understand things better than their teachers.&nbsp; And 
ignorance and self-conceit is a disease that is incurable; and 
besides, it usually carries great malice along with it.&nbsp; 
Many speak much and understand little.&nbsp; Others, again, speak
little and not very elegantly, and yet they have a sound 
understanding.&nbsp; There is such a thing as a holy simplicity 
that knows little of anything but of how to treat with God.&nbsp;
At the same time commend me to holy people of good heads.&nbsp; 
From silly devotees, may God deliver us!&nbsp; While all that is 
true, in the very act of prayer itself there is little necessity 
for learning, for the mind then, because of its nearness to the 
light, is itself immediately <!-- page 66--><a 
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
66</span>illuminated.&nbsp; I myself, who am what I am, even I am
a different person in prayer.&nbsp; It has often happened to me, 
who scarcely understand a word of what I read in Latin, when in 
deep prayer, to understand the Latin Psalms as if they were 
Spanish.&nbsp; At the same time, even for prayer, let those who 
have to teach and preach take full advantage of their learning, 
that they may help poor people of little learning, of whom I am 
one.&nbsp; Ministering with all learning and all intellectual 
ability to souls is a great thing, when it is done unto 
God.&nbsp; I have many experiences in prayer that I do not 
understand, and cannot explain or defend.&nbsp; Our Lord has not 
been pleased to give me the full intellectual understanding of 
all His dealings with me.&nbsp; That is the truth.&nbsp; Though 
you, my father, may think that I have a quick understanding, it 
is in reality not so.&nbsp; Sometimes my advisers used to be 
amazed at my ignorance how God carried on His work within 
me.&nbsp; It was there, but the way of it was a great deep to 
me.&nbsp; I could neither wade out unto God, nor down into 
myself.&nbsp; Though, as I have said, I loved to converse with 
men of mind as well as of heart.&nbsp; At the same time, my 
difficulties but increased my devotion, and the greater my 
difficulty the greater the increase of my devotion.&nbsp; Praise 
His Name.</p>
<h3>ON PRAYER</h3>
<p>(1) <i>The Price of Prayer</i>.&mdash;O Thou Lord of my soul, 
and my Eternal Good, why is it that when a soul resolves to 
follow Thee, and to do her best to forsake <!-- page 67--><a 
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>all for 
Thee,&mdash;why is it that Thou dost not instantly perfect Thy 
love and Thy peace within that soul?&nbsp; But I have spoken 
unadvisedly and foolishly, for it is we who are at fault in 
prayer, and never Thee.&nbsp; We are so long and so slow in 
giving up our hearts to Thee.&nbsp; And then Thou wilt not permit
our enjoyment of Thee without our paying well for so precious a 
possession.&nbsp; There is nothing in all the world wherewith to 
buy the shedding abroad of Thy love in our heart, but our 
heart&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; If, however, we did what we could, not 
clinging with our hearts to anything whatsoever in this world, 
but having our treasure and our conversation in heaven, then this
blessedness would soon be ours, as all Thy saints testify.&nbsp; 
God never withholds Himself from him who pays this price and who 
perseveres in seeking Him.&nbsp; He will, little by little, and 
now and then, strengthen and restore that soul, till at last it 
is victorious.&nbsp; If he who enters on this road only does 
violence enough to himself, with the help of God, he will not 
only go to heaven himself, but he will not go alone: he will take
others with him.&nbsp; God will give him, as to a good leader, 
those who will go after him.&nbsp; Only, let not any man of 
prayer ever expect to enjoy his whole reward here.&nbsp; He must 
remain a man of faith and prayer to the end.&nbsp; Let him 
resolve, then, that whatever his aridity and sense of indevotion 
may be, he will never let himself sink utterly under his 
cross.&nbsp; And the day will come when he will receive all his 
petitions in one great answer, and all his wages in one great 
reward.&nbsp; For he serves a good Master, who stands over him 
watching him.&nbsp; And let him never <!-- page 68--><a 
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>give over 
because of evil thoughts, even if they are sprung upon him in the
middle of his prayer, for the devil so vexed the holy Jerome even
in the wilderness.&nbsp; But all these toils of soul have their 
sure reward, and their just recompense set out for them.&nbsp; 
And, I can assure you, as one who knows what she is saying, that 
one single drop of water out of God&rsquo;s living well will both
sustain you and reward you for another day and another night of 
your life of life-long prayer.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Sin spoils Prayer</i>.&mdash;Now I saw that there would
be no answer to me till I had entire purity of conscience, and no
longer regarded any iniquity whatsoever in my heart.&nbsp; I saw 
that there were some secret affections still left in me, which, 
though they were not very bad perhaps in themselves, yet in a 
life of prayer such as I was attempting those remanent affections
spoiled all.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Eighteen Years of Misery in Prayer</i>.&mdash;It is not
without very good reason that I have dwelt so long on this part 
of my life.&nbsp; It will give no one any pleasure to see any one
so base as I was.&nbsp; And I wish all who read this to have me 
in abhorrence.&nbsp; I failed in all obedience, because I was not
leaning on my strong pillar of prayer.&nbsp; I passed nearly 
twenty years of my life on this stormy sea, constantly tossed 
with tempest and never coming to harbour.&nbsp; It was the most 
painful life that can be imagined, because I had no sweetness in 
God, and certainly no sweetness in sin.&nbsp; I was often very 
angry with myself on account of the many tears I <!-- page 
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>shed 
for my faults, when I could not but see how little improvement 
all my tears made in me.&nbsp; All my tears did not hold me back 
from sin when the opportunity returned.&nbsp; Till I came to look
on my tears as little short of a delusion: and yet they were 
not.&nbsp; It was the goodness of the Lord to give me such 
compunction even when it was not as yet accompanied with complete
reformation.&nbsp; But the whole root of my evil lay in my not 
thoroughly avoiding all occasions of sin, and in my confessors, 
who helped me at that time so little.&nbsp; If they had only told
me what a dangerous road it was I was travelling in, and that I 
was bound to break off all occasions of sin, I do believe, 
without any doubt, that the matter would have been remedied at 
once.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I can trace distinctly the mercy of God
to me in that all the time I had still the courage to pray.&nbsp;
I say courage, because I know nothing in the whole world that 
requires greater courage than plotting treason against the King, 
knowing that He knows it, and yet continuing to frequent His 
presence in prayer.&nbsp; I spent more than eighteen years in 
that miserable attempt to reconcile God and my life of sin.&nbsp;
The reason that I tell and repeat all this so often is that all 
who read what I write may understand how great is that grace God 
works in the soul when He gives it a disposition to pray on, even
when it has not yet left off all sin.&nbsp; If that soul 
perseveres, in spite of sin, and temptation, and many relapses, 
our Lord will bring that soul at last&mdash;I am certain of 
it&mdash;to the harbour of salvation, to which He is <!-- page 
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>surely bringing myself.&nbsp; I will say what I know by 
experience,&mdash;let him never cease from prayer, who has once 
begun to pray, be his life ever so bad.&nbsp; For prayer is the 
only way to amend his life, and without prayer it will never be 
mended.&nbsp; Let him not be tempted of the devil, as I was, to 
give up prayer on account of his unworthiness.&nbsp; Let him 
rather believe that if he will only still repent and pray, our 
Lord will still hear and answer.&nbsp; For myself, very often I 
was more occupied with the wish to see the end of the hour.&nbsp;
I used actually to watch the sand-glass.&nbsp; And the sadness I 
sometimes felt on entering my oratory was so great, that it 
required all my courage to force myself in.&nbsp; In the end our 
Lord came to my help: and, then, when I had done this violence to
myself, I found far greater peace and joy than when I prayed with
regale and rapture.&nbsp; If our Lord then bore so long with me 
in all my wickedness, why should any one despair, however wicked 
he may be?&nbsp; Let him have been ever so wicked up till now, he
will not remain in his wickedness so many years as I did after 
receiving so many graces from our Lord.&nbsp; And this more I 
will say,&mdash;prayer was the true door by which our Lord 
distributed out all His grace so liberally to me.&nbsp; Prayer 
and trust.&nbsp; I used indeed to pray for help: but I see now 
that I committed all the time the fatal mistake of not putting my
whole trust in His Majesty.&nbsp; I should have utterly and 
thoroughly distrusted and detested and suspected myself.&nbsp; I 
sought for help.&nbsp; I sometimes took great pains to get 
it.&nbsp; But I did not understand of how little use all that is 
unless we <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>root utterly all confidence out of 
ourselves, and place it at once, and for ever, and absolutely in 
God.&nbsp; Those were eighteen miserable years.</p>
<p>(4) <i>Aridity in Prayer</i>.&mdash;Let no one weary or lose 
heart in prayer because of aridity.&nbsp; For the Hearer of 
prayer comes in all such cases very late.&nbsp; But at last He 
comes.&nbsp; And though He confessedly comes late, He 
correspondingly makes up to the soul for all His delays, and 
rewards her on the spot for all her toil, and dryness, and 
discouragement of many years.&nbsp; I have great pity on those 
who give way and lose all this through not being taught to 
persevere in prayer.&nbsp; It is a bad beginning, and very 
prejudicial to proficiency in prayer, to use it for the gust and 
consolation that a man receives at the time.&nbsp; I know by my 
own experience, that he who determines to pray, not much heeding 
either immediate comfort or dejection, he has got into one of the
best secrets of prayer.&nbsp; I am troubled to hear that grave 
men, and men of learning and understanding, complain that God 
does not give them sensible devotion.&nbsp; It proceeds from 
ignorance of the true life of prayer, and from not carrying the 
cross into prayer as into all the rest of the spiritual 
life.&nbsp; He who begins to pray should be well told that he 
begins to plant a fine garden in very bad soil; a soil full of 
the most noxious and ineradicable weeds.&nbsp; And that after 
good herbs and plants and flowers have been sown, then he has to 
weed and water and fence and watch that garden night and day and 
all his life.&nbsp; Till the Lord of the garden is able to come 
and recreate and regale Himself where once there was <!-- page 
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
72</span>nothing but weeds, and stones, and noxious vermin.&nbsp;
Prayer, howsoever perfect in itself it may be, must always be 
directed in upon the performance of good works.&nbsp; We must not
content ourselves with the gift of prayer, or with liberty and 
consolation and gust in prayer.&nbsp; We must come out from 
prayer the most rapturous and sweet only to do harder and ever 
harder works for God and our neighbour.&nbsp; Otherwise the 
prayer is not good, and the gusts are not from God.&nbsp; The 
growth and maturity and fruitfulness of the soul do not stand in 
liberty in prayer, but in love.&nbsp; And this love is got not by
speaking much but by doing and suffering much.&nbsp; For my part,
and I have been long at it, I desire no other gift of prayer but 
that which ends in every day making me a better and better 
woman.&nbsp; By its fruits your prayer will be known to 
yourselves and others.</p>
<p>At other times I find myself so arid that I am not able to 
form any distinct idea of God, nor can I put my soul into an 
attitude of prayer, though I am in the place of prayer, and 
though I feel that I know something of God.&nbsp; This mind of 
mine at such times is like a born fool or some idiot creature 
that nothing can bind down.&nbsp; I cannot command myself.&nbsp; 
I cannot properly say one <i>Credo</i>.&nbsp; At such times I 
laugh bitterly at myself, and see clearly my own natural 
misery.&nbsp; I come then to see the exceeding favour of the Lord
in that He ever holds this insane fool fast in prayer and 
holiness.&nbsp; What would those who love and honour me think if 
they saw their friend in this dotage and distraction?&nbsp; I 
reflect at such times on the great hurt our original sin has <!--
page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>done us.&nbsp; For it is from our first fall that all 
this has come to us that we so wander from God, and are so often 
utterly incapable of God.&nbsp; But it is not so much 
Adam&rsquo;s sin as my own that works in me all this alienation 
and inability and aridity.&nbsp; Methinks I love God; but my 
actions, and the endless imperfections I see in myself, cause me 
great fear, and deep and inconsolable distress.</p>
<p>(5) <i>Prayer after Sin</i>.&mdash;Never let any one leave off
prayer on any pretence: great sins committed, or any other 
pretence whatsoever.&nbsp; For by leaving off prayer the soul 
will be finally lost, while every return to prayer is new life 
and new strength, as I am continually telling you.&nbsp; I tell 
you again that the leaving off of prayer was the most devilish 
and the most deadly temptation I ever met with.</p>
<p>(6) <i>Meditation in Prayer</i>.&mdash;He who prays should 
often stop to think with whom he speaks: who he himself is who 
speaks: who Jesus Christ is through whom he speaks: what that 
country is to which he aspires: how he may best please Him who 
dwells there: and what he is to do so that his character and 
disposition may suit with God&rsquo;s disposition and 
character.&nbsp; Mental prayer, as I am wont to call it, is the 
constant meditation of such things as these.&nbsp; And mental 
prayer ought to be endeavoured after by all, though they have no 
virtues, because it is the beginning of them, and therefore the 
one interest of all men is at once to begin such prayer.&nbsp; 
But it will be exercised with no little difficulty unless <!-- 
page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>the steady acquisition of the virtues accompanies 
it.&nbsp; In prayer it is far best to be alone; as, for our 
example and instruction, our Lord always was when He 
prayed.&nbsp; For we cannot talk both to God and man at the same 
moment.&nbsp; And, if we feel too much alone, and must have 
company, no company is comparable to Christ&rsquo;s 
company.&nbsp; Let us picture and represent Christ to ourselves 
and to His Father as always at our side.&nbsp; Those who pray 
with proper preparation: that is, with much meditation on the 
whole life and death of our Lord: on their own death: on the last
day, or such like, our Lord will bring all such to the port of 
light.&nbsp; Meditate much on the Sacred Humanity of our Lord: 
what He was on earth: what He said: what He did, and what He 
suffered.&nbsp; Because this life of ours is long and uphill, 
which to pass well through needs the constant presence with us of
our great Exemplar, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>(7) <i>The Presence of God in Prayer</i>.&mdash;In prayer 
there would sometimes come upon me such a sense of the Presence 
of God that I seemed to be all engulfed in God.&nbsp; I think the
learned call this mystical experience; at any rate, it so 
suspends the ordinary operations of the soul that she seems to be
wholly taken out of herself.&nbsp; This tenderness, this 
sweetness, this regale is nothing else but the Presence of God in
the praying soul.&nbsp; At the same time, I believe that we can 
greatly help toward the obtaining of God&rsquo;s Presence.&nbsp; 
We obtain it by considering much our own baseness, the neglect 
and the ingratitude <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>we show toward the Son of God, how 
much He has done for us, His passion and terrible suffering, His 
whole life so full of affliction, by delighting ourselves in His 
word and in His works, and such things as these.&nbsp; And if in 
these reflections the soul be seized with the Presence of God, 
then the whole soul is regaled as I have described.&nbsp; The 
heart is filled with relenting.&nbsp; Tears also abound.&nbsp; In
this way does the Divine Majesty repay us even here for any 
little care we take to serve Him and to be with Him.&nbsp; The 
life of prayer is just love to God and the custom of being ever 
with Him.</p>
<p>(8) <i>Supernatural Prayer</i>.&mdash;In supernatural prayer 
God places the soul in His immediate Presence, and in an instant 
bestows Himself upon the soul in a way she could never of herself
attain to.&nbsp; He manifests something of His greatness to the 
soul at such times: something of His beauty, something of His 
special and particular grace.&nbsp; And the soul enjoys God 
without dialectically understanding just how she so enjoys 
Him.&nbsp; She burns with love without knowing what she has done 
to deserve or to prepare herself for such a rapture.&nbsp; It is 
the gift of God, and He gives His gifts to whomsoever and 
whensoever He will.&nbsp; This, my daughters, is perfect 
contemplation: this is supernatural prayer.&nbsp; Now this is the
difference between natural and supernatural prayer: between 
mental and transcendental prayer.&nbsp; In ordinary prayer we 
more or less understand what we say and do.&nbsp; We think of Him
to whom we speak; we think about ourselves and about our Surety 
and Mediator.&nbsp; <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>In all this, by God&rsquo;s help, we 
can do something, so to speak, of ourselves.&nbsp; But in pure 
supernatural and transcendental prayer, we do nothing at 
all.&nbsp; His Divine Majesty it is who does it all.&nbsp; He 
works in us at such elect seasons what far transcends and 
overtops all the powers and resources even of the renewed 
nature.&nbsp; At the same time, as a far-off means of attaining 
to supernatural prayer, it is necessary to put upon ourselves the
acquiring of the great virtues, and especially, humility: we must
give up and resign ourselves wholly and entirely unto God.&nbsp; 
Whoever will not attempt to do this, with all the grace of God, 
that man will never come within sight of the highest 
prayer.&nbsp; Let him, in absolutely everything, seat himself in 
the lowest place.&nbsp; Let him account himself utterly and 
hopelessly unworthy of everything he possesses, both in nature 
and in grace.&nbsp; Let him shun advancement.&nbsp; Let him apply
himself to daily mortification, not of the body so much as of the
mind and the heart, and let him be more than content with the 
least thing that God allows him, for this is true humility.&nbsp;
In short, let His Majesty lead us in any way He pleases, and the 
chances are that He will soon lead us by these ways to a life of 
prayer and communion it had not entered into our hearts to 
conceive possible to such sinners as we are.&nbsp; Let no man be 
too much cast down, because he has not yet attained to 
supernatural prayer.&nbsp; God leads His people in the way that 
He chooses out as best for Him and for them.&nbsp; And he who 
stands low in his own eyes, may all the time stand high in 
God&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Supernatural prayer is not necessary to 
salvation: <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>nor doth God require it of us.&nbsp; 
They shall not fail of salvation who practise themselves in the 
solid virtues.&nbsp; No, they may have more merit in His eyes 
than their more favoured neighbours, because their obedience, and
their faith, and their love have cost them more.&nbsp; Their Lord
deals with them as with strong and valiant men, appointing them 
travail and trouble here, that they may fight for Him the good 
fight of faith, and only come in for the prize at the end.&nbsp; 
And, after all, what greater mark of a high election can there be
than to taste much of the cross?&nbsp; Whom the Lord loveth, in 
that measure He lays on them His cross.&nbsp; And the heaviest of
all our crosses is a life of sanctification and service without 
sensible consolation.</p>
<p>(9) <i>Over-familiarity in Prayer</i>.&mdash;He was a man of a
powerful understanding.&nbsp; I thought on his great gifts, and 
the possibilities there were in him of doing great service if he 
were once entirely devoted to God.&nbsp; He asked me to recommend
him much to God, and I did not need to be asked.&nbsp; I went 
away to the place to which I used to retreat in cases like 
this.&nbsp; And once there, I put myself into a state of entire 
recollection, and began to treat with our Lord in a way, when I 
think of it, of too great familiarity.&nbsp; But it was love that
spake, and every one allows love great familiarity, and no one so
much as our Lord.&nbsp; My soul overlooked the distance between 
herself and her Lord.&nbsp; She forgot herself, as she so often 
does, and began to talk impertinences and to take too great 
freedoms.&nbsp; I entreated our Lord with many tears.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>I judged my friend to be already a good man, but I must 
have him much better, and I said so too freely, I fear.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;O Lord,&rsquo; I remember I said,&rsquo; Thou must not 
deny me this favour that I ask.&nbsp; This is a man for us to 
make a friend of.&rsquo;&nbsp; And far more than that.&nbsp; And 
He did it.&nbsp; Yes, He did it.&nbsp; O His immense bounty and 
goodness!&nbsp; He regards not the words but the affection with 
which the words are uttered.&nbsp; That must be so, when He 
endures with such an impertinent and over-familiar and irreverent
wretch as I am; endures and answers.&nbsp; May He be blessed to 
all eternity!</p>
<p>(10) <i>The Best Result of Prayer</i>.&mdash;To Father 
Gratian.&nbsp; To-day I received three letters from your 
Reverence by the way of the head-post.&nbsp; The whole matter is 
in a nut-shell.&nbsp; That prayer is the most acceptable which 
leaves the best results.&nbsp; Results, I mean, in actions.&nbsp;
That is true prayer.&nbsp; Not certain gusts of softness and 
feeling, and nothing more.&nbsp; For myself, I wish no other 
prayer but that which improves me in virtue.&nbsp; I would fain 
live more nearly as I pray.&nbsp; I count that to be a good 
prayer which leaves me more humble, even if it is still with 
great temptations, tribulations, and aridities.&nbsp; For it must
never be thought that because a man has much suffering, therefore
he cannot have prayed acceptably.&nbsp; His suffering is as 
incense set forth before God.&nbsp; Tell my daughters that they 
must work and suffer as well as pray, and that it is the best 
prayer that has with it the most work and the most suffering.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>(11) <i>A Bishop taught to Pray</i>.&mdash;To Don Alonzo
Velasquez, Bishop of Osma.&nbsp; Your Reverence enjoined me the 
other day to recommend you to God.&nbsp; I have done so: not 
regarding my own inconsiderableness, but your requisition and 
your rights.&nbsp; And I promise myself from your goodness that 
you will take in good part what I feel compelled to say to you, 
and will accept that which proceeds only from my obedience to 
you.&nbsp; Recognising, then, and representing to our Lord, the 
great favours He has done you in having bestowed upon you 
humility, charity, zeal for souls, and a strong desire to 
vindicate the Divine honour, I still besought the Lord for an 
increase in you of all these same virtues and perfections in 
order that you may prove as accomplished in all these things as 
the dignity of your office requires.&nbsp; Till it was discovered
to me that you still wanted that which is the foundation of every
virtue, and without which the whole superstructure dissolves, and
falls in ruins.&nbsp; You want prayer.&nbsp; You want believing, 
persevering, courageous prayer.&nbsp; And the want of that prayer
causes all that drought and disunion from which you say your soul
suffers.&nbsp; That which was shown me as the way your lordship 
is henceforth to pray is this.&nbsp; You are to recollect and 
accuse yourself of all your sins since your last time of like 
prayer.&nbsp; You are to divest yourself of everything as if you 
were that moment to die.&nbsp; You are to begin by reciting to 
yourself and to God the Fifty-first Psalm.&nbsp; And after that 
you must say this.&nbsp; &lsquo;I come, O Lord, Bishop as I am, 
to Thy children&rsquo;s school of prayer and obedience.&nbsp; I 
come to Thee <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>not to teach, but to learn.&nbsp; I 
will speak to Thee, who am but dust and ashes.&rsquo;&nbsp; And 
all the time set before the eyes of your soul Jesus Christ 
crucified, and ruminate on Him in some such way as this.&nbsp; 
Fix your eyes on that stupendous humility of His whereby He so 
annihilated Himself.&nbsp; Look on His head crowned with 
thorns.&nbsp; Fix your eyes on His nailed hands, His feet, and 
His side.&nbsp; Meditate on and interrogate every one of His 
wounds for you.&nbsp; It behoves you also to go to prayer with a 
most entire resignation and submission and pliantness to go that 
way in religion and in life that God points out to you.&nbsp; 
Sometimes He will teach you by turning His back on you: and, 
anon, by lifting up the light of His countenance upon you.&nbsp; 
Sometimes by shutting you out of His presence, and sometimes by 
bringing you into His banqueting-house.&nbsp; And you are to 
receive it all with the same equability of mind, knowing that He 
always acts for the best.&nbsp; Otherwise you will go to teach 
God in your prayers, which is not the proper scope and intent of 
prayer at all.&nbsp; And when you say that you are dust and 
ashes, you must observe and exhibit the proper quality of 
such.&nbsp; In our Lord&rsquo;s prayer in the garden, He 
requested that the bitterness and the terrible trial He felt in 
overcoming His human nature might be taken away.&nbsp; He did not
ask that His pains might be taken away, but only the disgust 
wherewith He suffered them.&nbsp; And when it was answered Him 
that it was not expedient but that He should drink that cup, He 
had to master that weakness and pusillanimity of the flesh, as 
must all other men.&nbsp; One cannot be a <!-- page 81--><a 
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>great 
scholar, or even a finished courtier, without great pains and 
expense; and to be a scholar in the Church, and a minister, and a
master in the science of Heaven, cannot be done without long time
at school and much hard work.&nbsp; And herewith I desist from 
saying more to your lordship, whose pardon I beg for all this 
presumption.&nbsp; Which, however full it may be of defects and 
indiscretions, is not wanting in that zeal I owe to your service 
as one of the most wandering and gone astray of your 
lordship&rsquo;s flock.&nbsp; Our Lord preserve your lordship, 
and enrich you with the manifold increase of His grace.&nbsp; I 
am, your lordship&rsquo;s unworthy servant and subject, Teresa of
Jesus.</p>
<p>(12) <i>The proper Readers of what the Saint has 
Written</i>,&mdash;And now I return most humbly to beseech your 
Reverence, that, if you mean to impart to any one these things 
that you have made me write concerning prayer, let them be 
imparted to spiritual persons, and to persons of real insight 
only.&nbsp; For, indeed, I have written for persons of 
exceptional experience and exceptional prudence only.&nbsp; What 
I have written, I fear, very few are capable of.&nbsp; But what 
am I, to speak thus about any but myself?&nbsp; Farewell.&mdash;I
am,</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
